305,ICROWDN020200508eg58000mh,Shopify’s new app makes it easier for merchants to sell on Pinterest,"Merchants can turn their entire stores into discoverable product pins.

Pinterest is continuing its push to be a major online shopping destination through a new partnership with Shopify, which will make it easier for merchants to attract new customers and boost sales. Through a new app, Shopify merchants can now upload catalogs to Pinterest and turn their products into shoppable product pins in just a few clicks.","The Pinterest app on Shopify includes a bunch of helpful features, such as tag installation, automatic inventory updates and an ads-buying interface. The app automatically creates a connection between an individual store and Pinterest, so the merchant doesn’t have to edit code or add further resources — it’s all just there and ready to go.

This means Shopify merchants get access to distribution across Pinterest, as well as reporting and results tracking. Importantly, it’s a free service, so indie sellers ad big brands alike can get organic promotion without spending a penny. Of course, there is a paid option too, which lets merchants promote their pins as a paid ad, bringing customers directly into their brands online store. But Pinterest shoppers are generally pretty savvy and could likely find their own way there anyway, which makes this is a genuinely useful feature for everyone — not just those with spare marketing budget.

This is the latest push for Pinterest to drive shopping on its platform. Just last month it made things easier for pinners to buy what they see, while last year saw an explosion of activity from the company, including shopping-orientated Lens updates, a refreshed take on digital storefronts and the hiring of former Walmart CTO Jeremy King as head of engineering. No doubt there are more initiatives in the pipeline.

The Pinterest app on Shopify is available now for merchants in the US and Canada, and will go live in countries where Pinterest ads are available — including Australia, the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain — in the coming weeks.","Shopify’s new app makes it easier for merchants to sell on Pinterest Merchants can turn their entire stores into discoverable product pins.

New Initiative Enables Real-Time Data for Manufacturing Organizations to Accelerate Decision-Making, Proactively Manage Freight Exceptions and Increase Efficiency in Freight Operations","DETROIT, Sept. 21, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Covisint Corporation (Nasdaq:COVS), a leading cloud platform provider enabling the Internet of Things (IoT) and Identity Management-centric (IdM) solutions, and FreightVerify, a technology company transforming how business is done in the freight industry, today announced that they have launched a new in-transit inventory initiative that utilizes the latest connected technologies to provide real-time visibility.

Utilizing the Covisint Platform technologies, the FreightVerify service combines predictive analytics with real-time data so that organizations can proactively manage freight exception issues. For many manufacturing organizations, freight accounts for the largest expense and by providing greater visibility organizations can reduce expensive expedited freight costs, decrease the amount of buffer inventory on hand and minimize costly production scheduling issues. This new service brings together the many disparate connected services that are in place today including mobile devices, connected trucks and traditional messaging so that shipping organizations have a single, real-time view of operations.

""Freight is a massive part of the global supply chain and is comprised of a far-reaching network of shippers, carriers, logistics service providers and their extended ecosystem of customers and partners,"" said David McGuffie, President and CEO, FreightVerify. ""By combining the significant connected technologies that each of these groups brings to the table, we are able to deliver unprecedented visibility into their operations and that is invaluable to them. With Covisint's highly scalable and secure platform, and already connected global supply chain network, we're able to offer our customers a solution that gives them granular visibility and actionable insight into critical aspects of their supply chain, enabling them to reduce costs, increase productivity and drive their businesses forward.""

The flexibility of the Covisint Platform allows for industry-agnostic, on-demand elasticity, enabling FreightVerify to deliver infinitely scalable solutions to meet peak demands. The benefits each organization brings to the new initiative include:

Covisint:


   -- Enterprise-grade cloud platform, proven at scale with some of the world's 
      largest organizations. 
 
   -- Expertise in on-boarding complex B2B integrations for the largest 
      organizations in the world -- a capability that will be leveraged with 
      the FreightVerify service as new carriers are on-boarded. 
 
   -- Unique positioning within the global automotive supply chain, resulting 
      in simple connection of freight carriers from an end-to-end visibility 
      standpoint. 
 
   -- Ability to provide the end-to-end integrations and connections, where 
      FreightVerify provides the visibility solution. 

FreightVerify:


   -- Reduces redundant administrative cost, complexity and time burdens for 
      both Shippers and Carriers. 
 
   -- Provides greater visibility of in-transit inventory in real-time allowing 
      organizations to optimize their business. 
 
   -- Offers a simple, non-intrusive implementation process utilizing the power 
      of modern connected devices. 
 
   -- Allows for more accurate analytics on current business processes. 
 
   -- Enables organizations to proactively manage freight exceptions before 
      they become a problem. 

""The evolution of the Internet of Things and connected technologies is transforming the way organizations do business. The freight industry faces the same challenges, where it is increasingly important that links across supply chains are constantly connected -- ensuring that product is arriving when and where it should,"" said Sam Inman, Chairman and CEO, Covisint. ""We are enabling FreightVerify to deliver the kind of real-time mobile connectivity its customers expect. This relationship is a prime example of partner organizations leveraging our platform to address industry-specific business opportunities.""

The FreightVerify solution is being launched at the Automotive Logistics Global 2015 conference, taking place on September 22-24 in Detroit. Covisint and FreightVerify will be on hand to provide further details on the FreightVerify solution and the companies' partnership. To register for the event, click here.

224,JOENG00020191021efal0000p,BullGuard; BullGuard Launches Small Office Security to Protect Businesses From Cyber Threats,"2019 OCT 21 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Journal of Engineering -- Award winning cybersecurity company BullGuard released BullGuard Small Office Security, a new, powerful, cloud-managed endpoint security service for the small business market. BullGuard Small Office Security enables businesses to operate with the knowledge they are protected against identity and data theft, account takeover, malware such as ransomware, and other cyber threats.

BullGuard Small Office Security provides robust endpoint protection for desktops, laptops, tablets and smartphones, making it perfect for mobile workforces to work safely on their devices in the office, at home, or while hot desking or travelling. Small Office Security safeguards Windows(R), Android(R) and MacOS(R) devices and is backed by BullGuard's highly acclaimed live 24/7 technical support, while endpoint security management is simple via an easy-to-use cloud-based portal.","""Cybersecurity solutions for small offices are typically complex and challenging for businesses to deploy and use because they are re-engineered from legacy enterprise solutions designed for organizations with thousands of users,"" said Paul Lipman, CEO of BullGuard. ""Small businesses are more vulnerable to cyberattacks as cyber criminals increasingly focus their attention on the small office space and these companies are typically not as well protected as their enterprise counterparts. BullGuard Small Office Security is designed explicitly to meet the needs of today's small offices.""

At the heart of BullGuard Small Office Security is BullGuard's award-winning anti-malware protection, which consistently scores very highly in independent malware detection tests. Companies that fall victim to a cyberattack often experience significant downtime that seriously impacts productivity, data privacy, and even earnings. With BullGuard Small Office Security, small office businesses are fully protected by a proprietary multi-layered behavioural engine that stops all types of malware in its tracks. It also includes endpoint-based machine learning to bolster security even further with advanced zero-day threat detection, which ensures systems are protected even when offline, and without requiring signature updates.

Copyright 2019, NewsRx LLC","BullGuard; BullGuard Launches Small Office Security to Protect Businesses From Cyber Threats 2019 OCT 21 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Journal of Engineering -- Award winning cybersecurity company BullGuard released BullGuard Small Office Security, a new, powerful, cloud-managed endpoint security service for the small business market. BullGuard Small Office Security enables businesses to operate with the knowledge they are protected against identity and data theft, account takeover, malware such as ransomware, and other cyber threats.

BullGuard Small Office Security provides robust endpoint protection for desktops, laptops, tablets and smartphones, making it perfect for mobile workforces to work safely on their devices in the office, at home, or while hot desking or travelling. Small Office Security safeguards Windows(R), Android(R) and MacOS(R) devices and is backed by BullGuard's highly acclaimed live 24/7 technical support, while endpoint security management is simple via an easy-to-use cloud-based portal. ""Cybersecurity solutions for small offices are typically complex and challenging for businesses to deploy and use because they are re-engineered from legacy enterprise solutions designed for organizations with thousands of users,"" said Paul Lipman, CEO of BullGuard. ""Small businesses are more vulnerable to cyberattacks as cyber criminals increasingly focus their attention on the small office space and these companies are typically not as well protected as their enterprise counterparts. BullGuard Small Office Security is designed explicitly to meet the needs of today's small offices.""

At the heart of BullGuard Small Office Security is BullGuard's award-winning anti-malware protection, which consistently scores very highly in independent malware detection tests. Companies that fall victim to a cyberattack often experience significant downtime that seriously impacts productivity, data privacy, and even earnings. With BullGuard Small Office Security, small office businesses are fully protected by a proprietary multi-layered behavioural engine that stops all types of malware in its tracks. It also includes endpoint-based machine learning to bolster security even further with advanced zero-day threat detection, which ensures systems are protected even when offline, and without requiring signature updates.

Teradata QueryGrid(TM) provides unprecedented analytic power for data-driven businesses and extends the data lake value of Hadoop","PR Newswire

PRAGUE and SAN DIEGO, April 7, 2014

PRAGUE and SAN DIEGO, April 7, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Organizations are struggling to capture and interpret data that is spread across various analytic systems, each system handling different types of processing and data. Teradata (NYSE: TDC), the analytic data platforms, marketing applications and services company, today delivered the most complete big data solution in the industry with Teradata QueryGrid(TM), the only software that optimizes analytics across the enterprise and beyond.

Organizations are seeking the ability to scale the breadth and sophistication of their data analytics to respond to the demands of business operations. The challenge is how to best orchestrate a wide variety of new analytic engines, file systems, storage techniques, procedural languages and data types into one cohesive, interconnected, and complementary analytic architecture.

Attempts at federation have been unsuccessful for many reasons. To deliver value from big data, customers should create an architecture that allows the orchestration of analytic processes across parallel databases rather than federated servers. Teradata QueryGrid is the most flexible solution with innovative software that gets the job done,"" said Scott Gnau, president, Teradata Labs. ""After the user selects an analytic engine and a file system, Teradata software seamlessly orchestrates analytic processing across systems with a single SQL query, without moving the data. In addition, Teradata allows for multiple file systems and engines in the same workload.""

""Teradata pioneered integration with Hadoop and HCatalog with Aster SQL-H to empower customers to run advanced analytics directly on vast amounts of data stored in Hadoop,"" said Ari Zilka, CTO, Hortonworks. ""Now they are taking it to the next level with pushdown processing into Hadoop, leveraging the Hive performance improvements from Hortonworks' Stinger initiative, delivering results at unprecedented speed and scale.""

Teradata QueryGrid changes the rules of the game by giving users seamless, self-service access to data and analytic processing across different systems from within a single Teradata Database or Aster Database query. Teradata QueryGrid uses analytic engines and file systems to concentrate their power on accessing and analyzing data without special tools or IT intervention. It minimizes data movement and duplication by processing data where it resides.

Teradata Database 15, with QueryGrid capability, offers bi-directional data movement and pushdown processing to open-source Hadoop, Teradata Aster, and other databases. Queries can be initiated from the Teradata Database to access, filter, and return subsets of data from Hadoop, Aster, and other database environments to the Teradata Database for additional processing. The analysis can incorporate data from the Teradata Database and Hadoop.

The Teradata(R) Unified Data Architecture(TM), which brings together the Teradata Database, Teradata Aster Discovery Platform, and Hadoop technology, makes it possible for Teradata QueryGrid to extend and enrich Teradata and Aster queries, providing users with robust insights.

Users that leverage the Teradata Database and Teradata Aster Discovery Platform benefit from Teradata QueryGrid's bi-directional data movement and pushdown analytic processing. Teradata's future vision includes creation of sophisticated options that can connect analytic engines and file systems, which extend processing across the enterprise.

Teradata QueryGrid capabilities will be available in the third quarter of 2014.

(Nasdaq: CERN) would work with outside providers before signing a final contract, Secretary David Shulkin told Politico.","Shulkin announced in June that the VA would pick Cerner to update its aging EHR system to allow for easy back-and-forth communication of records with the Department of Defense. The North Kansas City-based health care IT company has deployed the MHS Genesis system at four DoD pilot sites, and has begun working on deploying the system to the entire DoD network by 2022.

The VA previously indicated that it expected to have a contract with Cerner last month. But other hurdles have stood in the way, including Congress moving over enough funds for the project to start. Shulkin requested $782 million for 2018, but the full cost of the 10-year contract has been estimated at $10 billion.

Shulkin's question is not around how well Cerner's system would work with entities within the VA's network, but whether it would be fully interoperable with private-sector providers offered through the VA's Choice Program.

Politico reported that the VA issued a request for information (RFI) for data-sharing solutions, and also may run ""case studies"" to see if the VA receives meaningful information after patients are sent through the system.

119,ELECWK0020140117ea1m001b3,QUALCOMM Incorporated; Patent Issued for Responding to an Interactive Multicast Message within a Wireless Communication System,"2014 JAN 22 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Electronics Newsweekly -- From Alexandria, Virginia, VerticalNews journalists report that a patent by the inventor Song, Bongyong (San Diego, CA), filed on September 17, 2008, was published online on January 7, 2014.

The patent's assignee for patent number 8625475 is QUALCOMM Incorporated (San Diego, CA).","News editors obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: ""The invention relates to communications in a wireless telecommunication system and, more particularly to methods of responding to an interactive multicast message within the wireless communication system.

""Wireless communication systems have developed through various generations, including a first-generation analog wireless phone service (1G), a second-generation (2G) digital wireless phone service (including interim 2.5G and 2.75G networks) and a third-generation (3G) high speed data/Internet-capable wireless service. There are presently many different types of wireless communication systems in use, including Cellular and Personal Communications Service (PCS) systems. Examples of known cellular systems include the cellular Analog Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS), and digital cellular systems based on Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), the Global System for Mobile access (GSM) variation of TDMA, and newer hybrid digital communication systems using both TDMA and CDMA technologies.

""The method for providing CDMA mobile communications was standardized in the United States by the Telecommunications Industry Association/Electronic Industries Association in TIA/EIA/IS-95-A entitled 'Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System,' referred to herein as IS-95. Combined AMPS & CDMA systems are described in TIA/EIA Standard IS-98. Other communications systems are described in the IMT-2000/UM, or International Mobile Telecommunications System 2000/Universal Mobile Telecommunications System, standards covering what are referred to as wideband CDMA (WCDMA), CDMA2000 (such as CDMA2000 1.times.EV-DO standards, for example) or TD-SCDMA.

""In wireless communication systems, mobile stations, handsets, or access terminals (AT) receive signals from fixed position base stations (also referred to as cell sites or cells) that support communication links or service within particular geographic regions adjacent to or surrounding the base stations. Base stations provide entry points to an access network (AN)/radio access network (RAN), which is generally a packet data network using standard Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) based protocols that support methods for differentiating traffic based on Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Therefore, the base stations generally interact with ATs through an over the air interface and with the AN through Internet Protocol (IP) network data packets.

""In wireless telecommunication systems, Push-to-talk (PTT) capabilities are becoming popular with service sectors and consumers. PTT can support a 'dispatch' voice service that operates over standard commercial wireless infrastructures, such as CDMA, FDMA, TDMA, GSM, etc. In a dispatch model, communication between endpoints (ATs) occurs within virtual groups, wherein the voice of one 'talker' is transmitted to one or more 'listeners.' A single instance of this type of communication is commonly referred to as a dispatch call, or simply a PTT call. A PTT call is an instantiation of a group, which defines the characteristics of a call. A group in essence is defined by a member list and associated information, such as group name or group identification.

""Conventionally, data packets within a wireless communication network have been configured to be sent to a single destination or access terminal. A transmission of data to a single destination is referred to as 'unicast'. As mobile communications have increased, the ability to transmit given data concurrently to multiple access terminals has become more important. Accordingly, protocols have been adopted to support concurrent data transmissions of the same packet or message to multiple destinations or target access terminals. A 'broadcast' refers to a transmission of data packets to all destinations or access terminals (e.g., within a given cell, served by a given service provider, etc.), while a 'multicast' refers to a transmission of data packets to a given group of destinations or access terminals. In an example, the given group of destinations or 'multicast group' may include more than one and less than all of possible destinations or access terminals (e.g., within a given group, served by a given service provider, etc.). However, it is at least possible in certain situations that the multicast group comprises only one access terminal, similar to a unicast, or alternatively that the multicast group comprises all access terminals (e.g., within a given cell, etc.), similar to a broadcast.

""Broadcasts and/or multicasts may be performed within wireless communication systems in a number of ways, such as performing a plurality of sequential unicast operations to accommodate the multicast group, allocating a unique broadcast/multicast channel (BCH) for handling multiple data transmissions at the same time and the like. A conventional system using a broadcast channel for push-to-talk communications is described in United States Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0049314 dated Mar. 1, 2007 and entitled 'Push-To-Talk Group Call System Using CDMA 1x-EVDO Cellular Network', the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As described in Publication No. 2007/0049314, a broadcast channel can be used for push-to-talk calls using conventional signaling techniques. Although the use of a broadcast channel may improve bandwidth requirements over conventional unicast techniques, the conventional signaling of the broadcast channel can still result in additional overhead and/or delay and may degrade system performance.

""The 3.sup.rd Generation Partnership Project 2 ('3GPP2') defines a broadcast-multicast service (BCMCS) specification for supporting multicast communications in CDMA2000 networks. Accordingly, a version of 3GPP2's BCMCS specification, entitled 'CDMA2000 High Rate Broadcast-Multicast Packet Data Air Interface Specification', dated Feb. 14, 2006, Version 1.0 C.S0054-A, is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.""

As a supplement to the background information on this patent, VerticalNews correspondents also obtained the inventor's summary information for this patent: ""Embodiments of the present invention are directed to wireless communication systems and methods of scheduling access terminal responses to an interactive multicast message are provided. A radio access network (RAN) generates an access control message (ACM), the ACM indicating feedback instructions for a plurality of access terminals (ATs) belonging to a given multicast group. The feedback instructions of the ACM designate a temporary manner in which the plurality of access terminals are to respond to an interactive multicast message. The target ATs receive the interactive multicast message as well as the ACM. The target ATs, or multicast group members, respond to the interactive multicast message based on the feedback instructions for the plurality of access terminals indicated by the ACM.""

260,DAMONL0020130610e96a001mw,Microsoft announces the new Xbox One will launch in November with a £429 price tag - and the new Halo game will come next year,"* Confirmation came at the E3 video game conference in Los Angeles

* Xbox 360 will be updated to look more like an Xbox One","* Microsoft alsoannounced Project Spark - a smart glass enabled game that allows you to create gaming worlds

* Xbox Live will no longer limited to 100 friends and that Microsoft points will be scrapped in favour of real money

Microsoft's new Xbox One gaming console will go on sale in November, it was announced today.

Speaking at the E3 video game conference in Los Angeles, bosses confirmed the new console will cost $499 or £429 - and the Xbox 360 will be updated to look more like an Xbox One.

Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft's vice president of marketing and strategy, says the updated Xbox 360 is 'smaller, sleeker and as quiet as ever' - and would be available in the U.S. from Monday.

He added that hundreds of new games are still coming to Xbox 360, which was originally released eight years ago as the high-definition successor to the Xbox. The gaming console has outsold rivals from Nintendo and Sony for the past two years.

The new Xbox 360 product was launched today at the conference in an attempt to maintain strong sales of the ageing consoles.

Microsoft also announced the latest Halo game - set for release next year. The follow up to last year's smash hit, Halo 4, it is part of an ever-growing Halo franchise that includes a live-action series.

Xbox Live Gold members  will also be two free games per month, including Halo 3 and Assassins Creed 2, E3 attendees heard.

Microsoft announced Project Spark - a smart glass enabled game that allows you to create gaming worlds.

The game, exclusive to Xbox One and Windows 8, it gives gamers a blank canvass to create their own gaming experience.

From flying goblins to huge mechanical robots, Spark gives gamers an infinite number of possibilities.

It was also revealed that Xbox Live will no longer limited to 100 friends and that Microsoft points will be scrapped in favour of real money.

Phil Spencer, corporate vice president, Microsoft Studios, said: 'Microsoft Studios is committed to making Xbox One the best place to play games, with more titles in development and more exclusives coming than at any time in the history of Xbox.

'With amazing games such as Forza Motorsport 5, Ryse: Son of Rome, Dead Rising 3, Halo Xbox One, Kinect Sports Rivals, Project Spark and Quantum Break, Xbox will continue to lead the industry with the biggest exclusives, new IP and blockbuster franchises that will delight gamers for the next decade and beyond.'

Microsoft Corp. said in a blog post last Thursday that it will not charge a fee to retailers, publishers or gamers for transferring their old games.

This means used games will be able to be played, clearing up a worry among gamers and video game retailers such as GameStop, which trade in used games.

That means video games discs users buy will not be limited to one Xbox One device, and players can share or trade in the games they have bought for other used games, just as they have been able to do in the past.

The Xbox One,will need to be connected online at least once every 24 hours to work. Some players had been concerned that the console was going to require a constant Internet connection.

Users will be able to access their games from other consoles through an online library after installing them on their primary device, but they will need to connect to the Internet at least every hour. They will be able to watch live TV and Blu-ray and DVD movies on the Xbox One without an Internet connection, Microsoft said.

When unveiling details of the Xbox One last month, Microsoft said it would be completely controlled using voice recognition and hand gestures, and with the new Instant Switching feature users can ask the Xbox to 'watch TV', 'open Internet Explorer' or use it to change channels quickly without having to find the remote control. 

Microsoft's Xbox One also comes with a multi-tasking Snap Mode that lets users run more than one service at any one time, such as watch a film while checking emails on Internet Explorer.

Microsoft executives also touted the Xbox One as a replacement for the set-top box.

The new Xbox One console will be shipped with a completely redesigned Kinect sensor. 

Kinect is Microsoft's motion-sensing technology that lets you play games using hand gestures and body movements.

The new sensor uses 'time of flight' that records photons bouncing off your body.

Microsoft claims it can collect over 2GB of data per second - including your heartbeat, weight transfer, slight joint movements and more - and then uses this data to measure your movements and react to your gestures.

Xbox Live manager Marc Whitten said that voice recognition with the new Kinect sensor is 'more conversational and supports the voices of the whole family.'

Whitten also explained that the Xbox controller has similarly been redesigned with more than 40 new components and new D-Pad makes the controller 'more immersive.'","Microsoft announces the new Xbox One will launch in November with a £429 price tag - and the new Halo game will come next year * Confirmation came at the E3 video game conference in Los Angeles

We hold schools, students, and soon teachers accountable. It's time to hold purveyors of failure accountable as well.","Founded in 2000 with funding from convicted Wall Street felon Michael Milken, K12 Inc. has a great business model. Virtual schools cut out the expensive brick & mortar facilities and move the entire school online where students can point and click their way to a high school diploma. No schoolhouse means no light bill, no cafeteria, no janitors, and no gym teacher. Their overhead is a fraction of a neighborhood public school, but thanks to a loophole snuck into the same 2011 bill that cut funding for Texas public schools by $5.4 billion, virtual schools get funded at the same level.

K12 Inc. might be great for its investors, but it's horrible for its students. Everywhere virtual schools have been tried they have failed to meet minimum standards or do better than public schools, according to a report by Progress Texas. K12 Inc. is so ineffective that the NCAA announced last month that it was K12 Inc. credits would no longer count towards eligibility.

The problem with running schools like a business is that Wall Street is usually the model. Last year, the company paid $6.75 million to settle a class-action securities lawsuit that alleged K12 Inc. lied to investors about academic performance, enrollment figures, and student retention. The Florida Department of Education investigated allegations that K12 Inc. asked employees to cover up its use of uncertified teachers, and then the Securities and Exchange Commission investigated K12 Inc. when the company failed to disclose the Florida probe to investors.

Because of these problems, former TEA Commissioner Robert Scott kept K12 Inc.'s enrollment caps low, but after he announced his resignation on May 1, 2012 TEA staff interpreted a new state law as lifting enrollment caps for virtual schools. Perhaps anticipating Scott's refusal to adopt the rule, TEA staff did not present this finding to the Commissioner until Gov. Rick Perry appointed Williams that August.

Soon after, Williams issued a rule that essentially deregulated online virtual schools. According to an agency spokeswoman, the new rule ""eliminate[d] the requirement for application to the agency to operate full-time online schools and eliminate enrollment caps."" Hindsight might be 20/20, but Williams' decision to open the state treasury to a company with such a lousy track record both in the classroom and in the boardroom still doesn't make sense.

Perhaps coincidentally, about two week before Perry announced Williams as his new education chief, Williams attended Andrea McWilliams' 40th birthday party at a Sonoma winery, an event so lavish it made the society pages. McWilliams is also a lobbyist for K12 Inc. In political circles, her birthday party weekend in wine country is best remembered for not being disclosed on her ethics filing as required by state law because a handful of state lawmakers attended, including Sen. Dan Patrick and Rep. Jim Pitts, then the chairman of appropriations.

Williams, who did not disclose receiving any gifts from lobbyists on his financial disclosure form, seemed to enjoy the party where guests received gift bags according to a published report. The party also featured a surprise appearance by rapper Ton Loc, prompting Williams to tweet, ""Ton Loc makes surprise visit to Andrea McWilliams' birthday party. Crowd goes wild over wild thing.""

Even after restoring some of the 2011 cuts to public schools, education funding continues to lag behind population growth in Texas, so it is a cruel exception of generosity that Abbott, the gubernatorial frontrunner, likes virtual schools. If we truly wanted to run schools like a business, it is doubtful we would invest in a proven failure, no matter who their friends were.

This next generation of the Skyjet App makes chartering a jet as easy and seamless for clients as if they were summoning their own jet. With just a few taps, it provides:

DURHAM, N.H. & LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 20, 2015-- ","The University of New Hampshire InterOperability Laboratory (UNH-IOL), an independent provider of broad-based testing and standards conformance services for the networking industry, today announced at the Broadband World Forum extensive support for the ultra-fast broadband standard, G.fast, including an ongoing G.fast Certification Beta Program prior to the official program launch in 2016, a growing G.fast Consortium, one of the first public demonstrations of G.fast interoperability to deliver 4K Ultra HD TV, and an upcoming seventh G.fast plugfest in November. At the Broadband World Forum, UNH-IOL Senior Engineer Lincoln Lavoie will speak to how G.fast and G.fast certification support the recently announced Broadband Forum 20/20 Vision. He'll present on the topic, The Impact of G.fast on the Wider Network, during the session, Interoperability for G.fast across the Network, on 21 October 2015 at 14:00 BST inside the exhibition floor Access Zone. The UNH-IOL's booth is located within the Broadband Forum's Interoperability Pavilion (D20).

Service providers are supporting G.fast because it can significantly reduce the cost of the last-drop into a home or business, as compared to an all-fiber deployment. They are looking for certified assurances that customer premise equipment (CPE) and demarcation point unit (DPU) devices will interoperate correctly, lowering testing, rollout and troubleshooting costs. The high throughput of G.fast also promises to boost customer satisfaction, thus reducing churn and driving revenue. Ensuring interoperability of CPE and DPU devices is critical to maintaining satisfactory customer experiences. Additional conformance testing ensures that products deliver the performance required to maintain a high level of customer satisfaction.

G.fast Consortium, Certification Beta Program, Plugfests and White Paper

Selected in 2014 as the Broadband Forum's first and only official test site for the G.fast Certification Program, the UNH-IOL launched the G.fast Consortium a year ago to nurture a vibrant ecosystem of manufacturers and support the accelerated adoption of the G.fast standard by service providers. As with similar UNH-IOL programs, membership in the G.fast Consortium benefits manufacturers by giving them access to a certification program that service providers are including in their RFP requirements. The formal G.fast Certification Program, which will be housed at the UNH-IOL, is currently on target to launch during the first half of 2016 with the first certified devices also expected in 2016. However, to date, more than a dozen Broadband Forum member companies, including CPE and DPU manufacturers and chipset companies, are already engaged in the G.fast Certification Beta Program, debugging issues early on and preparing the test plan, interoperability test bed, and first devices to be certified. In addition to ensuring that all testing is completely accurate, the G.fast Consortium is also developing in-house automation software that will keep testing times short for member companies after launch.

""We're grateful to our Beta Program participants, who are helping to ensure that the official G.fast Certification Program will provide the best possible quality right from the start,"" said UNH-IOL Senior Engineer Lincoln Lavoie. ""We'd also like to encourage all G.fast stakeholders to contact us now to get a head start on prepping their products and scheduling testing in advance of the formal program launch.""

Multiple vendors already have engaged in a series of six G.fast chipset interoperability plugfests, which began in January 2015. The next plugfest, scheduled for November 2-6, will involve updated software and firmware developed by participants during the past several months. To help companies interested in certification going forward, the UNH-IOL has produced a downloadable white paper on the topic, ""G.fast Certification Test Setup & Calibration.""

G.fast Interop Demo at Broadband World Forum

The UNH-IOL is also leading one of the first public demonstrations of G.fast interoperability with multiple vendors. The live exhibit is taking place at the Broadband Forum's Interoperability Pavilion at the Broadband World Forum. This demonstration verifies interoperability between systems vendors using the chipset from Sckipio Technologies, showing the high-bandwidth, low-latency capabilities of G.fast to deliver exciting new applications and services, such as 4K Ultra HD TV. The demonstration will include multiple CPE devices connected to each DPU, and also will show the vectoring -- or crosstalk cancellation -- capabilities of G.fast. This demonstration marks a significant milestone in G.fast interoperability testing, but it is only the first step, as the official G.fast Certification Program is being designed to prove true any to any interoperability.

""The Broadband Forum's Interoperability Pavilion will showcase a number of technologies, including GPON, VDSL2, TR-069 and G.fast. We are delighted to welcome our partners at the UNH-IOL and applaud their progress toward G.fast testing that will deliver the range of certified products that the industry expects,"" said Robin Mersh, CEO of the Broadband Forum.

268,INVWK00020170901ed9100162,Computer Companies; Patent Issued for Residual Material Detection in Backdrilled Stubs (USPTO 9739825),"2017 SEP 9 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Investment Weekly News -- A patent by the inventors Bartley, Gerald K. (Rochester, MN); Becker, Darryl J. (Rochester, MN); Doyle, Matthew S. (Chatfield, MN); Germann, Philip R. (Oronoco, MN); Maxson, Mark O. (Mantorville, MN), filed on July 8, 2016, was published online on August 22, 2017, according to news reporting originating from Alexandria, Virginia, by VerticalNews correspondents.

Patent number 9739825 is assigned to International Business Machines Corporation (Armonk, NY).","The following quote was obtained by the news editors from the background information supplied by the inventors: ""The present disclosure relates to printed circuit boards, and more specifically, to backdrilling in vias of printed circuit boards.

""Often multiple vias may be used in a multi-layered printed circuit board to electrically connect conductive traces in differing conductive layers of the board. During the manufacturing of the printed circuit board, the vias may be created by plating predrilled holes in the board with a conductive material (typically Copper). The entire depth of the via, including an unused portion of the via called a stub, may be plated with the copper material. In this context, a stub may refer to the portion of the via extending beyond an intended trace escape layer within the board. Left unchanged, the plated stub portion may adversely degrade electrical signals traveling through the desired portion of the via (i.e., into the desired trace escape layer) during use of the completed circuit board.

""In order to reduce the impact of stubs on circuit board performance, the stubs may be removed from the board, or at least shortened, during the manufacturing process. One method for removing stubs is called backdrilling. In this process, a drill bit, preferably one which has a slightly larger diameter than the bit used in predrilling the hole for the via (prior to plating), may be used by a drill for boring into the via and removing the plating material from its stub portion. Once the undesirable plating material is carved out, and the stub is effectively removed, the stub's negative impact on electric signals passing through the board may be substantially reduced.""

In addition to the background information obtained for this patent, VerticalNews journalists also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: ""According to embodiments of the present disclosure, aspects of the disclosure may include a method, a system, and a computer program product for measuring and assessing the adequacy of a backdrilling operation. The method, system, and computer program product may include backdrilling a stub of a via formed in a printed circuit board to a predetermined depth. A capacitance probe may be positioned within the via. Then the capacitance probe may be used to obtain a test capacitance measurement. The test capacitance measurement may be compared to a predetermined baseline capacitance measurement. Residual conductive plating material in the backdrilled stub may cause the test capacitance measurement to exceed the predetermined baseline capacitance measurement. An indication may be made that the predetermined baseline capacitance measurement has been exceeded.

""The above summary is not intended to describe each illustrated embodiment or every implementation of the present disclosure.""

Our reports deliver fact-based news of research and discoveries from around the world. Copyright 2017, NewsRx LLC","Computer Companies; Patent Issued for Residual Material Detection in Backdrilled Stubs (USPTO 9739825) 2017 SEP 9 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Investment Weekly News -- A patent by the inventors Bartley, Gerald K. (Rochester, MN); Becker, Darryl J. (Rochester, MN); Doyle, Matthew S. (Chatfield, MN); Germann, Philip R. (Oronoco, MN); Maxson, Mark O. (Mantorville, MN), filed on July 8, 2016, was published online on August 22, 2017, according to news reporting originating from Alexandria, Virginia, by VerticalNews correspondents.

Patent number 9739825 is assigned to International Business Machines Corporation (Armonk, NY). The following quote was obtained by the news editors from the background information supplied by the inventors: ""The present disclosure relates to printed circuit boards, and more specifically, to backdrilling in vias of printed circuit boards.

""Often multiple vias may be used in a multi-layered printed circuit board to electrically connect conductive traces in differing conductive layers of the board. During the manufacturing of the printed circuit board, the vias may be created by plating predrilled holes in the board with a conductive material (typically Copper). The entire depth of the via, including an unused portion of the via called a stub, may be plated with the copper material. In this context, a stub may refer to the portion of the via extending beyond an intended trace escape layer within the board. Left unchanged, the plated stub portion may adversely degrade electrical signals traveling through the desired portion of the via (i.e., into the desired trace escape layer) during use of the completed circuit board.

""In order to reduce the impact of stubs on circuit board performance, the stubs may be removed from the board, or at least shortened, during the manufacturing process. One method for removing stubs is called backdrilling. In this process, a drill bit, preferably one which has a slightly larger diameter than the bit used in predrilling the hole for the via (prior to plating), may be used by a drill for boring into the via and removing the plating material from its stub portion. Once the undesirable plating material is carved out, and the stub is effectively removed, the stub's negative impact on electric signals passing through the board may be substantially reduced.""

In addition to the background information obtained for this patent, VerticalNews journalists also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: ""According to embodiments of the present disclosure, aspects of the disclosure may include a method, a system, and a computer program product for measuring and assessing the adequacy of a backdrilling operation. The method, system, and computer program product may include backdrilling a stub of a via formed in a printed circuit board to a predetermined depth. A capacitance probe may be positioned within the via. Then the capacitance probe may be used to obtain a test capacitance measurement. The test capacitance measurement may be compared to a predetermined baseline capacitance measurement. Residual conductive plating material in the backdrilled stub may cause the test capacitance measurement to exceed the predetermined baseline capacitance measurement. An indication may be made that the predetermined baseline capacitance measurement has been exceeded.

""The above summary is not intended to describe each illustrated embodiment or every implementation of the present disclosure.""

57,NYCBJO0020160516ec5g00031,Second tech IPO of the year offers some hope to others,"Acacia Communications, a Massachusetts-based optical networking equipment company, soared in its first day of trading on Friday, offering some hope for other tech companies who are waiting out one of the longest IPO droughts in the sector in a long time.

Acacia, whose backers include Summit Partners, Commonwealth Capital Ventures and Matrix Partners, is only the second tech IPO of the year. The other one, from Dell spinoff SecureWorks (NASDAQ:SCWX), priced below its targets, plunged below its offering price and stayed there ever since.","Acacia, on the other hand, raised $104 million by offering 4.5 million shares at $23, the high end of its target range of between $21 and $23. (  Learn more about Acacia here.)

Its stock jumped by more than 30 percent above it IPO price in early trading, hitting as high as $30.56.

Acacia (NASDAQ:ACIA) is the seventh IPO from Massachusetts this year,  according to the Boston Business Journal, with all of the rest coming from the biotech and life sciences sectors.

In comparison, the nation's largest tech center — the San Francisco Bay Area — has had only one IPO this year and its last tech offering came in early December when Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) went public at $21 a share. That one has has managed to stay above its offering price after coming out of the gates with a healthy jump, closing Friday at $21.93.

Bloomberg's Silicon Valley Tech Index is down by about 13 percent in the past year when IPOs dropped dramatically in the region.

A survey  released this week of tech dealmakers by the law firm of Morrison & Foerster showed that public market volatility is contributing heavily to pessimism that IPOs will pick up this year. About 58 percent forecast a continued decline in the number of new public offerings.

But if Acacia can hold onto its strong debut momentum it could show that public investors have some appetite for new tech offerings.

The patent's inventors are Meeks, David T. (Ashland, MA); Saillet, Yannick (Stuttgart, DE).","This patent was filed on March 9, 2012 and was published online on February 9, 2016.

From the background information supplied by the inventors, news correspondents obtained the following quote: ""Data quality monitoring tools allow a user to define data rules describing conditions that data should fulfill to meet predefined quality standards or describing how data is transformed from a source to a target. A data rule is typically an expression describing a condition or a transformation that can involve one or more column or one or more variables. Data rules can be complex and usually use a language, such as SQL or a proprietary language to define the logic of the data rule. For example, a typical data rule expressions could be: 'EMPLOYEE.AGE>0', specifying that the column AGE of the table EMPLOYEE must have positive values, or 'EMPLOYEE.ID UNIQUE' specifying that each value in the column ID must be unique, or even more complex conditions, such as 'IF CUSTOMERS.AGE<18 THEN CUSTOMERS.MARITAL_STATUS=`child`' specifying that depending on the value of a specific column, the value of another column is constrained.

""As may be seen, data rules are usually bound to the physical names of the sources upon which they operate. Thus, in existing solutions, the definition of the rule contains the name of the tables or columns upon which the rule is applied. In the example above, the data rule 'EMPLOYEE.AGE>0' implies that the column being tested is a column named AGE contained in a table EMPLOYEE. In conventional solutions, data rules are not generally defined to be portable. That is, if a user decides to apply a given data rule on a different column, then the data rule needs to be redefined. Therefore, if a user wants to apply the original data rule, 'EMPLOYEE.AGE>0,' to a new column of data such as 'PRODUCTS.WEIGHT,' the user must redefine the original data rule to include the new location of the data. A new data rule--'PRODUCTS.WEIGHT>0'--must be created. Additionally, as may be appreciated, the new data rule is not related to the original data rule.

""In like manner, if a user decides to apply the original data rule against a different value then the data rule needs to be redefined. Therefore, if a user wants to apply the original data rule, 'EMPLOYEE.AGE>0,' to a new value such as '65,' the user must redefine the original data rule to include the new value. A new data rule--'EMPLOYEE.AGE>65,' '--must be created. Additionally, as above, the new data rule is not related to the original data rule.

81,AUSTLN0020171222edcn0001f,HNA faces US probe over its Beijing ties,"US politicians are calling for a ­national security panel to increase its scrutiny of billions of dollars in US investments by HNA Group, including possibly revoking its approval of earlier deals by the Chinese conglomerate.

The requests from Capitol Hill follow recent allegations by a US firm that HNA provided “knowingly false, inconsistent, and misleading information” about its ownership and ties to the Chinese government during the inter-agency panel’s review of a $US325 million ($422m) deal. The allegations were aired in a lawsuit filed this month by Ness Technologies, which had been trying to sell a New Jersey-based software engineering subsidiary to a Beijing-based unit of HNA.","A spokesman for the Chinese firm said HNA disputed the allegations. “This baseless and extortionist lawsuit by Ness makes egregiously inaccurate and fanciful claims that HNA has ties to the Chinese government and wilfully misled CFIUS (the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US),” the spokesman said.

The complaint has already drawn the attention of some on Capitol Hill who have been growing increasingly concerned about the lack of clarity surrounding the Chinese conglomerate’s ownership.

Regulators in New Zealand blocked an HNA deal on Thursday for the same reason. “If these allegations are true, the government should consider using its ability to suspend future HNA transactions or retroactively reopen previous HNA agreements,” Republican representative Robert Pittenger told The Wall Street Journal, referring to the Ness lawsuit.

Mr Pittenger is one of the sponsors of bipartisan legislation to broaden the power of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US. The multi-agency body, led by the Treasury Department, reviews foreign deals by companies such as HNA and can advise the president to block takeovers on national security grounds.

CFIUS approved HNA’s $US6 billion deal to buy California-based technology distributor Ingram Micro, which closed in December 2016, and the Chinese firm has been trying for some time to get approval from the panel to buy a controlling stake in SkyBridge Capital, the investment firm owned by former White House adviser Anthony Scaramucci.

The HNA spokesman said the Skybridge transaction was on track. Mr Scaramucci declined to comment.

Two Democratic politicians — representative Rosa DeLauro, who is co-sponsoring the bill, and representative Brad Sherman — also urged stepped-up scrutiny of HNA in statements to the Journal.

“The claims raised by Ness are further proof that congress needs to enact long-overdue CFIUS reform, which includes increasing the resources available to fully ­investigate transactions,” Ms De­Lauro said.

Michael Wessel, a member of the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, which provides recommendations to congress, told the Journal that HNA’s “pending and future deals should be halted … and previous deals should be reassessed with any new facts”. The complications with the HNA and Ness deal started in April. That was when Pactera Technology International — the HNA subsidiary that was buying some of Ness’s assets — notified CFIUS about the deal, according to Ness.

The notice prompted multiple rounds of follow-up questions from the committee because HNA did not fully disclose its ownership and ties to the Chinese government, Ness alleged.

In late August, Pactera disclosed “for the first time” that Chen Feng, HNA’s co-chairman, “held a current government position in China”, according to the lawsuit. It is unclear what government position Ness was referring to. Mr Chen was a delegate to the Chinese Communist Party’s national congress for more than a decade, and until July was the chairman of the Hainan Province Federation of Industries and Commerce, a business chamber-like ­organisation that has government endorsement.

The HNA spokesman said: “Chen Feng does not hold a government position.”He added that the company “will vigorously defend against these allegations while respecting the confidentiality of the CFIUS process”.","HNA faces US probe over its Beijing ties US politicians are calling for a ­national security panel to increase its scrutiny of billions of dollars in US investments by HNA Group, including possibly revoking its approval of earlier deals by the Chinese conglomerate.

258,INTEWK0020190423ef4n000pf,"International Business Machines Corporation; Patent Issued for Vertical Field Effect Transistors (USPTO 10,256,156)","2019 APR 23 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Information Technology Newsweekly -- From Alexandria, Virginia, VerticalNews journalists report that a patent by the inventors Anderson, Brent A. (Jericho, VT); Nowak, Edward J. (Essex Junction, VT), filed on May 25, 2018, was published online on April 22, 2019.

The patent's assignee for patent number 10,256,156 is International Business Machines Corporation (Armonk, New York, United States).","News editors obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: ""A vertical field-effect transistor (FET) has a channel perpendicular to the substrate surface, as opposed to being situated along the plane of the surface of the substrate. By using this design, it is possible to increase packing density. That is, by having the channel perpendicular to the substrate surface, vertical FETs improve the scaling limit beyond planar finFETs.

""However, vertical FETs are still severely challenged past the 7 nm node due to high aspect ratios, Vmax limits, and material thickness not scaling well. For example, insulator material and shared contacts formed between gate material of adjacent vertical FETs make it very difficult to scale the devices beyond the 7 nm node, basically due to material thicknesses, leakage concerns, breakdown voltage, decreased resistances and capacitance, etc. Accordingly, these constraints make it very difficult to decrease gate pitch in current vertical FET designs.""

As a supplement to the background information on this patent, VerticalNews correspondents also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: ""In an aspect of the invention, a structure comprises at least one vertical fin structure and gate material contacting with the at least one vertical fin structure. The structure further comprising metal material in electrical contact with the ends of the at least one vertical fin.

""In an aspect of the invention, a structure comprises: at least two adjacent fin structures of semiconductor material with a source region and a drain region at opposing ends; gate material about the two adjacent fin structures and between the opposing ends; a space between the gate material of the two adjacent fin structures; and drain contacts and source contacts at the opposing ends of the two adjacent fin structures on the source region and the drain region.

""In an aspect of the invention, a method comprises: forming at least one vertical fin structure; forming gate material contacting with the at least one vertical fin structure; and forming source and drain contacts at ends of the at least one vertical fin structure by deposition of metal material in electrical contact with the silicide regions.""

The claims supplied by the inventors are:

""What is claimed:

""1. A method, comprising: forming first and second gate structures each comprising: a fin body composed of semiconductor material, the fin body having a first end and a second end opposite the first end; a top portion of semiconductor material on the second end of the fin body and having a width larger than that of the fin body; a first silicide contact at the first end of the fin body; a second silicide contact at the top portion of the semiconductor material on the second end of the fin body; a gate dielectric material on a sidewall of the fin body; and a gate material on the gate dielectric material.

""2. The method of claim 1, wherein the gate dielectric material is between the first silicide contact and the second silicide contact.

""3. The method of claim 1, further comprising forming a dielectric material surrounding each of the first and second gate structures.

""4. The method of claim 3, further comprising forming an air gap in the dielectric material between the first and second gate structures.""

The move is raised the ire of market watchers, who are accusing the company of violating net neutrality principles and creating an unequal playing field, Recode reported.

Go90 is Verizon's all-in-one mobile entertainment app for smartphone and tablet that provides access to over 21,000 titles and more than 50 exclusive original series in the US, as well as live music and live sports. Customers can update to the latest version of the app on the App Store or Google Play.","Verizon's argument for the legality of the service is that go90 is open to other content providers via its sponsored data programme, FreeBee Data 360, which lets content providers pay for customers' data costs. A Verizon spokesperson told Re/code that “FreeBee Data 360 is an open, non-exclusive service available to other content providers on a non-discriminatory basis. “Any interested content provider can use FreeBee Data 360 to expand their audiences by giving consumers the opportunity to enjoy their content without incurring data charges,” the spokesperson said.

With AT&T also looking to launch a mobile vide service involving sponsored data, industry watchers have noted that Verizon's move will be a test bed to see how the FCC responds.","Verizon Wireless gets outcry as it launches no caps for go90 Verizon Wireless has announced that all go90-registered post-paid customers can now watch go90 video content anytime on Verizon's LTE network, without paying for data time.

For the first time ever, Canadian city drivers and sports fans can book hassle-free parking and outsmart the crowd with third-party parking reservations at over 20 partner parking lots and garages. Parking Panda is furthering its North American presence alongside its partnership announcement with the Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment (MLSE), Canada's preeminent leader in delivering top quality sport and entertainment experiences.","With the ability to compare available options and prices, drivers can plan ahead as they search, reserve, and pay for event and everyday parking throughout downtown Toronto. Parking Panda's partnership with MLSE allows the company to further its reach to the Greater Toronto Area by offering sports fans and event goers an easier way to park for games and other entertainment experiences. Proud fans can now pre-book parking within easy walking distance of the Air Canada Centre, home to the Toronto Maple Leafs, Toronto Raptors, and the Toronto Rock.

""We're excited to announce our first international expansion in such a beautiful city and to provide Canadian customers with a smarter and easier way to park,"" said Parking Panda CEO Adam Zilberbaum. ""Through parking reservations made in-app or online, Parking Panda is helping alleviate the pain of parking. Our quick, smart, and hassle-free service allows Toronto drivers to plan ahead, and know how much they're going to pay before heading downtown or to the Air Canada Centre. Customers can rest easy knowing they have a parking spot waiting and that they can use the extra time they would have spent in traffic on the more important things in life, like dinner downtown with the family or a Maple Leafs game with dad.""

With one-hour parking as low as five dollars, Toronto customers can view all Parking Panda locations on an interactive map showing real-time availability and distance. Once a pre-purchased reservation is made, customers can easily access parking passes through the mobile app. In addition, drivers booking at select PandaScan locations in Toronto can access parking through the company's innovative, fully-automated scanning technology. PandaScan allows customers to use their phone to easily scan in and out of locations, creating the most streamlined experience in parking to date.

""Our partnership with Parking Panda is another important step in our goal of delivering the best experience in sports and entertainment for our fans at Air Canada Centre and our other venues,"" said Wayne Zronik, Vice President Facilities and Live Entertainment for MLSE. ""That experience for our fans begins before they even arrive at our venues and driving to our events is easier now that fans have an innovative tool that eliminates the challenge of searching for convenient parking. We work every day to improve the fan experience and this partnership does that by creating hassle-free travel to downtown Toronto.""

In addition to taking advantage of MLSE event- and game-day parking that starts at six dollars, city drivers can book guaranteed parking near attractions throughout the city, including the CN Tower, Harbourfront Centre, the Hockey Hall of Fame, the Metro Toronto Convention Centre, and the Rogers Centre, among others.

47,TOIDEL0020210120eh1k0002i,"How AWS's Priya Ponnapalli is using AI in Formula 1, NFL","THE GURUWhat's the probability of a shot going into goal? Which Formula 1 car is best on high-speed corners, which on straights? Which player should a team buy?AI and machine learning (ML) are being used in fascinating ways in sports to help players and sports administrators take better decisions, and to enable broadcasters to offer new and real-time data that enriches the fan experience.

In Amazon Web Services (AWS), it's Priya Ponnapalli's job to enable these solutions. Priya grew up in Hyderabad, did her engineering there, and then went to the University of Texas in Austin for a Master's and PhD in electrical and computer engineering. She is today principal scientist and senior manager on the Amazon machine learning solutions team.","The question, she says, is no longer whether a company should have a ML strategy, but rather how they can quickly and effectively get their ML strategy into motion.""We have been working with some of the largest sports organisations in the world - Formula 1, the US National Football League (NFL), Nascar, Bundesliga and many more. We start with the business problems and work backwards from there to solve it using innovations,"" she says.

NFL has built ML models using Amazon's flagship ML service, Sage-Maker, and its own vast troves of data - images, videos, data from RFID tags on players' shoulder pads and on the football. Today, those models enable NFL to track complex data on the field, such as the precise X-Y coordinates of a player, speed and movement patterns. Priya says this data helps NFL officiate the game better. ""They are also sent to the broadcast booths for additional insights, and are used to enhance the fan experience,"" she says.

NFL team Seattle Seahawks uses the system to collect ongoing information about players, like their exertion level, their explosive movements, how often they work out, and more. This helps, Priya says, to generate new insights into player injuries, game rules, equipment, rehabilitation and recovery.

In F1, each car has some 120 sensors on them generating over 3GB of data each second. F1 uses Sage-Maker to train deep learning models with 65 years of historical race data. And then they use the system to make race predictions, track critical race performance statistics, and give fans insights into split second decisions and strategies adopted by teams and drivers.

Each team builds a car with what they see as the ideal mix of grip, downforce, drag and power. And so each car has its own strengths and weaknesses. On F1's TV coverage, the ML system creates car performance scores graphics based on the numerous data points it captures - how each car performs in different kinds of corners, on straights, how much it understeers, oversteers.

For the German football league Bundesliga, models have been created that can precisely determine what is the goal probability of different kinds of shots. The ML algorithm has been trained on shots on goal, looking at distance and angles of goals, position of opposition defenders, goalkeeper's position, the speed of the player at the moment he shoots. So, a split second before a goal, the model can tell fans the probability of a goal.""As we get more data, models improve,"" says Priya.","How AWS's Priya Ponnapalli is using AI in Formula 1, NFL THE GURUWhat's the probability of a shot going into goal?

According to news originating from Riverside, California, by VerticalNews correspondents, research stated, ""Schedulers used by modern OSs (e.g., Oracle Solaris 11 (TM) and GNU/Linux) balance load by balancing the number of threads in run queues of different cores. While this approach is effective for a single CPU multicore system, we show that it can lead to a significant load imbalance across CPUs of a multi-CPU multicore system.""","Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of California, ""Because different threads of a multithreaded application often exhibit different levels of CPU utilization, load cannot be measured in terms of the number of threads alone.

By Will Hamel","How does a video game series as long, memorable, frustrating and legendary as Metal Gear Solid come to a close? With a game that’s long, memorable, frustrating and, for more reasons than one, legendary.

“Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain” is the (supposed) conclusion to the Metal Gear franchise, which began in 1987. The franchise reached major popularity in 1998, when its PS1 release “Metal Gear Solid” redefined how video games were experienced. Instead of merely testing your dexterity and problem-solving skills, “Metal Gear Solid” delivered a rich, cinematic and gleefully absurd story about the evils of nuclear war. The amount of cut scenes almost matched the amount of gameplay, which was continued for the series’ later installments like “MGS 2: Sons of Liberty” (the franchise’s Matrix Reloaded equivalent), “MGS 3: Snake Eater” (my pick for best video game ever) and “MGS 4: Guns of the Patriots” (I still don’t understand what happened, except one character needs a toilet).

Interestingly, this does not apply to story-light gameplay-heavy Phantom Pain, which follows the story of Big Boss, who, after suffering a nine-year coma at the conclusion of Ground Zeroes (Phantom Pain’s prequel game), escapes an under-attack hospital to formulate his own private military in order to hunt those who wronged him. As Big Boss, you’re dropped into historical-era 1980s combat zones of Afghanistan and Angola in an open-world setting. You can partake in story missions, side-quests or innocent exploring across the hostile terrain rife with enemy soldiers. This is a stealth game, and it behooves you to find quiet, oftentimes non-lethal solutions to your missions, though you can certainly run and gun your way through the game if you choose.

And that’s the game’s greatest gameplay mechanic: choice. While open-world gameplay has been around since Grand Theft Auto popularized the concept in the mid-2000s, Phantom Pain takes it to another level with its rich environments that offer countless options for sneaking, or blowing stuff up if that’s how you roll. Unlike previous games, where the player more or less was forced to sneak past robotic, predictable guards in a confined space, any given base here has multiple ways inside. While the guards sightlines was incredibly slim (they always are in a Metal Gear game), their movements are far less predictable. The environment can also turn on you via sand storm, rain or more, which means every trip to any area in the game offers something new.

As you progress through the game you are encouraged, and other times demanded, to extract knocked-out enemy soldiers (and bears if you choose) to your military base. The soldiers extracted join your organization and can be sent out into battle (unfortunately not the bears). As you earn more money completing missions, you’ll expand your base, which you can use in online multiplayer against other players.

Yet Metal Gear Solid has always been at its heart a single player game, which is why it was surprising and disappointing to see that the attention to detail that so obviously was applied to the gameplay was not applied to the game’s story. Cut scenes are few and far between, and multiple story threads are abandoned near the game’s conclusion.

This is no doubt due in part to the game’s troubled development. Konami and game creator Hideo Kojima (take a drink every time you see his name plastered in the game, I dare you), parted ways during the game’s production, and as a result there have been reports of multiple story missions that were simply abandoned as a result. This results in a game that feels stilted, undeveloped and lacking in the emotional resonance that permeated previous installments. The game’s “true” ending does pack a punch; it’s somewhat tragic for those who have followed the series thoroughly, but otherwise a player can’t help but ask his or herself, after 100+ hours of gameplay, if it was all worth it.

After contemplation, the answer is definitely yes, as the detailed and enjoyable gameplay will keep you entertained hours on end. It may disappoint those like me who played every game repeatedly, and it may confuse others who are new to the series, but otherwise Phantom Pain makes itself one of the most memorable games of this console generation, for reasons good and bad.

84,KRTEI00020181120eebk0008h,Gannon University launches cybersecurity program,"Nov. 20--A proposal made a year ago by engineering and computer science faculty at Gannon University found its way to the boardroom Friday, where trustees voted to launch two new majors and approve money to design a data center and academic building likely to cost more than $20 million.

Speaking to an invited crowd of about 75 people Monday morning, Gannon President Keith Taylor announced the university will offer new majors in cyber-engineering and cybersecurity.","Taylor said the data center and the new academic program will eventually be housed in the former Verizon building at 131 W. Ninth St., renamed Knight Tower, which Gannon purchased in 2016 for use as a temporary library.

The six-story building is also expected to take on a new name that might conjure up the crimes and misdeeds future Gannon students will be expected to address. The building will be called IHACK, an acronym for the Institute of Health and Cyber Knowledge.

In an interview with the Erie Times-News, Taylor and Walter Iwanenko Jr., vice president for academic affairs for Gannon, said they see the new majors as a logical next step for a university that already has significant staff in electrical engineering, computer science and computer information systems.

But they also see Gannon playing a substantial role in workforce development as Erie positions itself as a secure Smart City focused on addressing issues about cybersecurity.

The initial vision for the six-story Knight Tower calls for space for cyber labs; a hacking lab; a defense lab, where students would learn to defend against hackers; and a lab where they would study internet devices and how they can be protected.

Taylor said that leaves plenty of space for the creation of a secure data center and two floors that could be leased for commercial space, ideally to companies working in the area of cybersecurity.

""There will be 30,000 or 40,000 square feet available for new or growing businesses coming in,"" he said. ""That's 300 or 400 people that could go into that building. There are huge opportunities for Erie in that facility.""

That space, Taylor said, can help address an emerging need for downtown office space -- a need that didn't exist until recently thanks to new energy surrounding the EDDC, the Erie Innovation District, the Erie Technology Incubator and other efforts taking place in Erie.

""In our minds, this pairs perfectly with the work the Erie Innovation District is doing with this whole concept of the safe, secure city,"" Taylor said. ""Mercyhurst is doing work that is more on the analytic, forensic side of things. Our strength is 50-plus years with electrical engineering and computer science programs. We are already building and designing these systems.""

Iwanenko said he sees almost unlimited employment potential in a field that has 3 1/2 million unfilled openings.

""There are cyber programs that do a really great job at protecting information,"" he said. With faculty and students in electrical engineering, computer science and related disciplines, ""What we can offer is the whole continuum, including how the data is stored and kept safe and how that information is used.""

As the name IHACK suggests, Gannon hopes to develop a particular focus in the area of health care and health-care data systems.

""One of our most vulnerable areas is health care,"" Iwanenko said. ""People are wearing FitBits. People have pacemakers. How do we protect that information? There have been hundreds of millions of people impacted by health-care data breaches. When they get that information, they can hold people for ransom.""

That's why Gannon includes hospitals and health systems among its potential clients when it envisions the secure data center it hopes to build.

Iwanenko said that health care won't be the only focus, but that Gannon will look to its own expertise in the field as a training ground for health-care professionals as it looks to establish partnerships with health-care companies in need of secure data centers or other services.

While no formal partnerships have been formed, Taylor said Gannon is expected to sign a memo of understanding to work with the Pennsylvania Army National Guard, which is led by Maj. Gen. Timothy J. Hilty, a member of the Gannon trustees.

Taylor said he's not sure whether Gannon will take on construction partners or tackle the project alone.

""The idea is we are going to build this facility. We could start construction next summer,"" he said. ""We could run with this, but we don't want to shut off possibilities. We could do this on our own, but it would be great to find a potential partner that brought something to the table. I really think this is a huge, next opportunity, not just for Gannon, but for Erie.""

John Persinger, CEO of the Erie Downtown Development Corp., which is working to rebuild the city of Erie's population by investments in real estate and creating a new level of activity downtown, sees the Gannon announcement as helpful to the EDDC cause.

""They are going to be educating the workers of the future and creating the jobs of the future,"" he said.

Mayor Joe Schember echoed that sentiment Monday, saying that Gannon was helping to build the foundation of Erie's future.

Gannon, which plans to start recruiting for its new majors this week, projects it will have 180 students in cybersecurity and cyber-engineering within three years. The university, which plans to offer a graduate program, will also offer a minor in cybersecurity that will be part of its criminal justice program.

Taylor stressed Monday that the idea came from the faculty, who were eager to run with the concept.

""The beauty at a university is when it's from the ground up,"" he said. ""You can take a great idea and make it even better. That's what this is.""

The multi-institutional teams being announced at SU2C's Scientific Summit draw from the nation's top academic research centers and will have access to Microsoft Research's experts in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Each team will be comprised of experts in life sciences, physical sciences, mathematics and engineering and will have the opportunity to work collaboratively with Microsoft's machine learning experts to discover key aspects of the interaction between cancer and the immune system that can lead to the development of new treatments.","In addition to the significant support from Microsoft, the Lustgarten Foundation for Pancreatic Cancer Research committed $1.76 million in funding, and the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) will provide $1 million to support post-doctoral fellows on five of the seven teams, providing an opportunity for early-career scientists to work with leading researchers.

""It's an exciting new time in cancer research. Investigation of the human genome and individual tumor genetics is producing mammoth amounts of data that need to be interpreted in order to deliver the best possible cancer care,"" said Phillip A. Sharp, PhD, chairman of the SU2C Scientific Advisory Committee and institute professor at the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 2011, Dr. Sharp co-authored the seminal MIT white paper, ""The Third Revolution: The Convergence of the Life Sciences, Physical Sciences, and Engineering.""

""Our first convergence research cohort, announced in 2016, established the effectiveness of a broad multidisciplinary approach for creating models for how cancer grows and reacts to treatment,"" said Arnold J. Levine, PhD, chair of the SU2C Convergence Initiative, co-vice chairman of the SU2C Scientific Advisory Committee and Professor emeritus, Institute for Advanced Study. Through the collaboration with Microsoft and using well characterized, de-identified patient data, we will look at how individuals vary in their immune responses to an array of therapies. And we will create standardized measurement protocols that may speed the development of cancer therapies and ultimately save lives.""

Working with Microsoft machine learning experts, SU2C researchers will be able to study terabytes of data derived from multiple data sets, including information on the patient's genome, imaging studies, medical and medication records, among other data. Over the course of three years, the Stand Up To Cancer Convergence 2.0 Research Teams will explore a host of factors that may contribute to a patient's response to a specific regimen, including: DNA mismatch repair, tumor-specific proteins from mutated genes, cytokine function and natural killer cells. These therapies will be studied both when they do work, and when they don't, to inform medical practice.

Our reports deliver fact-based news of research and discoveries from around the world. Copyright 2018, NewsRx LLC","Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C); Stand Up To Cancer Announces $11M Collaborative, Multi-Disciplinary Research Program; Microsoft Will Bring Power of AI to Investigate Immune System Response to Cancers 2018 FEB 12 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Cancer Vaccine Week -- Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C) announces a ""Convergence 2.0"" research initiative that awards $11 million to seven multi-disciplinary research teams to investigate immune system response to cancers. The multi-institutional teams being announced at SU2C's Scientific Summit draw from the nation's top academic research centers and will have access to Microsoft Research's experts in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Each team will be comprised of experts in life sciences, physical sciences, mathematics and engineering and will have the opportunity to work collaboratively with Microsoft's machine learning experts to discover key aspects of the interaction between cancer and the immune system that can lead to the development of new treatments. In addition to the significant support from Microsoft, the Lustgarten Foundation for Pancreatic Cancer Research committed $1.76 million in funding, and the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) will provide $1 million to support post-doctoral fellows on five of the seven teams, providing an opportunity for early-career scientists to work with leading researchers.

""It's an exciting new time in cancer research. Investigation of the human genome and individual tumor genetics is producing mammoth amounts of data that need to be interpreted in order to deliver the best possible cancer care,"" said Phillip A. Sharp, PhD, chairman of the SU2C Scientific Advisory Committee and institute professor at the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 2011, Dr. Sharp co-authored the seminal MIT white paper, ""The Third Revolution: The Convergence of the Life Sciences, Physical Sciences, and Engineering.""

""Our first convergence research cohort, announced in 2016, established the effectiveness of a broad multidisciplinary approach for creating models for how cancer grows and reacts to treatment,"" said Arnold J. Levine, PhD, chair of the SU2C Convergence Initiative, co-vice chairman of the SU2C Scientific Advisory Committee and Professor emeritus, Institute for Advanced Study. Through the collaboration with Microsoft and using well characterized, de-identified patient data, we will look at how individuals vary in their immune responses to an array of therapies. And we will create standardized measurement protocols that may speed the development of cancer therapies and ultimately save lives.""

Working with Microsoft machine learning experts, SU2C researchers will be able to study terabytes of data derived from multiple data sets, including information on the patient's genome, imaging studies, medical and medication records, among other data. Over the course of three years, the Stand Up To Cancer Convergence 2.0 Research Teams will explore a host of factors that may contribute to a patient's response to a specific regimen, including: DNA mismatch repair, tumor-specific proteins from mutated genes, cytokine function and natural killer cells. These therapies will be studied both when they do work, and when they don't, to inform medical practice.

""We're thrilled to collaborate with Stand Up To Cancer on this amazing opportunity to merge Microsoft's state-of-the-art machine learning expertise, our work with the intelligent cloud, and our world-class research capabilities with their network of renowned researchers and clinicians - all to accelerate progress in cancer immunotherapy.

216,KMCR000020201214egcb0000c,Amazon moves closer to net-zero goal with 3.4 GW of renewable power purchases,"Amazon.com Inc. signed contracts to purchase power from 26 renewable energy projects on four continents totaling 3.4 GW as part of its target to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040.

The wind and solar projects are in Australia, France, Germany, Italy, South Africa, Sweden, the U.K. and the U.S. The projects will supply renewable energy for Amazon's corporate offices, fulfillment centers and data centers, according to a Dec. 10 news release.","Some of the contracted projects are owned by BP PLC, Engie SA and Ørsted A/S.

BP will supply Amazon with an additional 404 MW of wind power in Europe beginning in 2022. The projects consist of a 275-MW facility in Sweden and two wind farms totaling 129 MW in Scotland.

The oil and gas major had agreed to supply to Amazon subsidiary Amazon Web Services Inc. with 170 MW of renewable power in December 2019. BP said the deal is part of its goal to transform into an integrated energy company and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

French utility Engie is supplying 650 MW of renewable power to Amazon from projects in the U.S., Italy and France.

In the U.S., the power supply contract covers 569 MW from wind and solar facilities in Delaware, Kansas, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia, which are expected to reach commercial operation in 2021 through 2022. The contract also includes up to 66 MW in Italy and 15 MW in France.

Danish energy company Ørsted is selling 250 MW from its planned 900-MW Borkum Riffgrund 3 offshore wind farm in Germany for 10 years. This deal marks Amazon's first offshore wind power purchase agreement.

""With a total of 127 solar and wind projects, Amazon is now the biggest corporate buyer of renewable energy ever. We are on a path to running 100% of our business on renewable energy by 2025 — five years ahead of our original target of 2030,"" Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos said.

The company's current renewable energy portfolio consists of 59 utility-scale wind and solar projects and 68 solar rooftops on fulfillment centers and sort centers around the globe.

""The U.S.-based projects alone make Amazon's announcement 270% larger than the largest corporate procurement announcement from a single off-taker to date and showcase the company's leadership and commitment to a clean and prosperous energy future,"" said Miranda Ballentine, CEO of the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance.

In the U.S., Amazon has signed wind and solar contracts in California, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas and Virginia.

(Severna Park, MD); Vahlberg, Matthew William (Severna Park, MD), filed on July 27, 2015, was published online on November 22, 2016.

The patent's assignee for patent number 9501535 is Leidos, Inc. (Reston, VA).","News editors obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: ""The problem to be solved generally, is how to manage and analyze big data, e.g., on the order of petabytes of data. Big data is broadly defined as data sets with sizes beyond the ability of commonly-used software tools to capture, curate, manage, and process the data within a reasonable amount of time. The world's information doubles approximately every two years. This information (or data) includes critical intelligence, but the mining of such intelligence becomes cost prohibitive and takes too long for many end-users and applications. Whereas traditional data sets include narrow subsets of historical, structured, static data populating relational databases; big data presents a particularly difficult problem for end-users as it is unlimited, may be both structured and unstructured, is frequently available in real-time and may be iterative. Such big data is simply too much for the present relational database management systems without significant processing, which is time consuming and ultimately renders much of the data outdated and of limited value.

""FIG. 1 illustrates an existing process for correlating data. As shown, multiple exemplary data sets D.sub.1 to D.sub.4 from various sources are loaded onto separate databases (DB.sub.1 to DB.sub.4) for separate access by an application or user (hereafter 'user'). Additional contextual data to augment the relevance of sources D.sub.1 through D.sub.4 are accessible directly to the user (D.sub.5 and D.sub.6). The user must correlate and process the data from the data sets to generate a result. The report generation process is time consuming and highly manual, requiring a large investment of time from the user.

""A number of existing data warehousing techniques address the backend correlation changes of scenarios such as depicted in FIG. 1 Dimensional modeling has been used to organize data in a data warehouse to increase its analytical value and support end-user queries by adding dimension data to fact data to provide context. This is described in multiple papers by Ralph Kimball; see, for example, 'A Dimensional Modeling Manifesto' Aug. 2, 1997, Kimball Group (www.kimballgroup.com), which is incorporate herein by reference in its entirety. While the dimensional modeling technique is available to structure the data after it is saved in DB.sub.1 to DB.sub.4 to support end user queries, this is a backend technique.

""Accordingly, there is a need in the art for an improved system and method for front end processing of big data for near real-time availability for alerting, query and analysis by one or more users.""

As a supplement to the background information on this patent, VerticalNews correspondents also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: ""In a first exemplary embodiments, a process for data collection and conditioning is described. The process includes: receiving multiple data records from multiple data sources at a processing engine, wherein the multiple data records have different formats from each other and from a pre-established internal data format; parsing in near real time by at least one parser each of the multiple data records into multiple constituent parts; translating in near real time by at least one translator each of the multiple data records using their parsed multiple constituent parts into a pre-established internal data format; comparing in near real time by the processing engine each of the multiple translated internal data records with at least a first enrichment rule to determine if the at least a first enrichment rule is applicable to the translated internal data record; if applicable, enriching in near real time by the processing engine the translated internal data record with additional data pursuant to the at least a first enrichment rule to form an enriched translated internal data record; and transmitting in near real time the enriched translated internal data record to at least one data sink for storage therein, wherein the enriched translated internal data record is available for use by multiple applications.

""In a second exemplary embodiment, a process for data collection and conditioning is described. The process includes: receiving multiple data records from multiple data sources at a processing engine; holding the received multiple data records in a first queue to await processing; pulling the received multiple data records off of the first queue by a designated number of ingest nodes for processing; monitoring continuously during the process at least one of first queue size and a rate at which received multiple data records are pulled off of the first queue; determining that the first queue size or rate are outside of an acceptable range; allocating or deallocating ingest nodes to or from the designated number of ingest nodes automatically during the process in accordance with the determination; transmitting from the designated number of ingest nodes in near real time the processed multiple data records to a second queue; holding the received processed multiple data records in the second queue; pulling the received processing multiple data records off of the second queue by a designated number of data sink nodes for processing; monitoring continuously during the process at least one of second queue size and a rate at which received processed multiple data records are pulled off of the second queue; determining that the second queue size or rate are outside of an acceptable range; allocating or deallocating data sink nodes to or from the designated number of data sink nodes automatically during the process in accordance with the determination; and transmitting in near real time each of the processed multiple data records to at least one of the multiple data sinks for storage therein, wherein the processed multiple data record are available for use by multiple applications.

""In a third exemplary embodiment, a system for data collection and conditioning is described.

The location-monitoring feature will begin rolling out Wednesday in an update to the Google Maps mobile app, which is already installed on most of the world's smartphones. It will also be available on personal computers.","Google believes the new tool will be a more convenient way for people to let someone know where they are without having to text or call them. The Mountain View, California, company has set up the controls so individuals can decide with whom they want to share their whereabouts and for how long — anywhere from a few minutes to indefinitely.

But location sharing in one of the world's most popular apps could cause friction in marriages and other relationships if one partner demands to know where the other is at all times. Similar tensions could arise if parents insist their teenagers turn on the location-sharing option before they go out.

Similar tracking is already available on other apps; Glympse, founded by former Microsoft employees, has offered this function for years. That's one of the reasons Google isn't expecting a lot of complaints about adding the option to Maps, especially since everyone can decide when to turn it on and who can monitor them.

“We don't feel like we are changing the game,"" said Jen Fitzpatrick, Google's vice president of maps.

Maps users will be able to activate the location-sharing feature by tapping a button near the search bar and then picking a person from their contact list to text with the information. If the recipient doesn't have the Google Maps app on their phone, it will text them a link to open the location on the map in a browser.

The settings also allow users to determine how long their movements can be tracked each time a location is shared. If no time limit is selected, Google will periodically send people email reminders that they're still sharing their location.","Google Maps already tracks you; now other people can, too SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google Maps users will soon be able to broadcast their movements to friends and family via the app — the latest test of how much privacy people are willing to sacrifice in an era of rampant sharing.

The patent's assignee for patent number 8392891 is Microsoft Corporation (Redmond, WA).","News editors obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: ""Developers of performance-critical multi-threaded software often try to avoid the overhead of traditional locking. Traditional techniques for doing so include making direct use of hardware primitives for atomic operations (such as interlocked exchange, or compare and swap) or employing regular loads and stores for the purpose of synchronization. Unfortunately, such 'low-lock' programs are notoriously difficult to implement systems with a relaxed memory consistency model. Subtle bugs can arise in these programs due to memory operation reordering caused by the relaxed memory model of the underlying hardware. These errors are hard to find and debug as they most often show up only in specific thread interleavings and in particular hardware configurations.

""Low-lock code is used heavily both in low-level libraries and in critical paths of a system. Because these parts of the system are crucial to the reliability of the entire system, it is important to develop verification techniques.

Each distinct code path is known as an 'execution' of the program under testing. The analysis algorithm may detect the existence of non-sequentially consistent executions of the program under test while analyzing only sequentially consistent executions of the program under test. In one embodiment, individual executions of the program under test, such as executions obtained by running the program in a testing environment, are analyzed by the detection module. In another embodiment, all executions of the program are systematically enumerated and analyzed by the detection module. In one embodiment, the detection module is run simultaneously with the program under test; in another embodiment, a trace file is first generated from the program under test and the detection module analyzes that trace file offline.

""In yet another embodiment, the detection module receives a memory trace comprising a plurality of memory access events each representing the execution of a memory access instruction issued by the program under test on a computer having a sequentially consistent memory model. The detection module determines whether the memory access instructions could, when executed on a computer having a relaxed memory model, be executed in an order in which they could not have been executed on the sequentially consistent computer. The result of the determination is an indication whether or not the memory access instructions, and thus the test computer program they were derived from, are relaxed memory model safe.

13,DJDN000020130408e948004tn,"Barron's Blog: HP's Donatelli: Pulling Stuff Out of the Lab, into the World","(This story has been posted on Barron's Online's Tech Trader Daily blog at http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily.)

By Tiernan Ray","Sprinting from a conference call earlier today to announce new server products, Hewlett-Packard ( HPQ) head of enterprise technology David Donatelli was kind enough to swing by Barron's offices, essentially to refute some of the things I said in a column two weeks ago about the challenges HP faces.

The broad picture for HP, from what Donatelli had to share, is that the company, which had the most patents of anyone in Silicon Valley last year, according to Donatelli, is more rapidly rolling out the inventions of its venerable HP Labs than it had in recent years. Donatelli, who has been at HP for four years now, has helped the enterprise group productize three different inventions of HP Labs, including Project Moonshot, the subject of today's server announcement; something called StoreOnce, for "" data de-duplication""; and StoreAll, to help compliance and legal departments perform data analysis on the vast troves of archived material companies amass.

Donatelli spoke of the enthusiasm for "" poster session"" tech meet-ups inside HP, where the company's inventors get to swap cool new stuff with the enthusiasm of a high school science fair. They even get to see some of their posters become real product.

Today's presentation on Moonshot was actually generation two of the slimmed-down servers. These machines run either Intel's ( INTC) "" Atom"" processor, a low-power alternative to traditional microprocessors that has been dedicated to smartphones and tablet computers, but that can be used for server workloads; or chips from Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD), Texas Instruments ( TXN), startup Calxeda, and other licensees of the ARM Holdings ( ARMH) chip architecture. (When asked whether the Calxeda chips were relatively more important, because of HP's partnership with the startup, Donatelli smiled and said, ""We love all of our children equally well.)

The servers, with either chip architecture, take up just one eighth the space of traditional "" x86"" servers, are 89% more power-efficient, and can cost 77% less. Donatelli even brought samples of the servers blades to show off. Today's products are available in the Atom flavors, with ARM-based models coming to market in the near future.

The whole point of these servers is not just that they're cheaper and more efficient, but also that they can be tailored to certain workloads. Donatelli gave the example of a oil exploration company that can use the DSP power of a Texas Instruments-based server for the heavy floating-point calculations inherent in that business. Donatelli wouldn't say whose ARM chips are in the sample he brought with him.

When I asked if ARM-based processors might replace the x86-based Atom, he was adamant that's not the case. ""These can really scale out,"" he says of Atom. ""Intel has really gotten behind this."" The ARM-based models will use 32-bit versions of the chips, though HP looks forward eagerly to the first-available 64-bit ARM chips, Donatelli told me.

Why is this better than what others offer? For one thing, it takes a lot of intellectual property and science to put together such stripped-down servers; you and I couldn't simply buy TI or AMD chips and build them, he points out. And two, vertically-integrated "" appliance"" servers, of the sort that Oracle ( ORCL) offers with its "" Exalytics"" and "" Exalogic"" machines, while they have a place in the market, don't offer the kind of broadly applicable compute power that today's Web and cloud computing data centers require. ""How many exaclogic servers do you think you'll find inside of most Web data centers?"" Donatelli asked, rhetorically.

To Donatelli, Moonshot is part of the biggest change to come to computing in 25 years. It is the advent of the "" third wave,"" in his terms, of computing. First was the mainframe, from the 1960s to the middle 1980s. Then came client server computing, and Donatelli points out HP was the first to commercialize x86 servers, starting in 1989. ""People back then thought it was crazy; who would ever want to use PC technology for servers,"" he observes.

Now, the third wave will be ""convergence,"" and ""converged infrastructure, "" a term HP coined, he maintains, that many others have copied. Donatelli overseas not just servers, but also the company's networking and storage capabilities. He concedes that so far, numbers for storage and networking and server don't necessarily reflect cross-polination in customer accounts. But you will start to see that, he told me. Customers are starting already to buy with an eye to how getting multiple pieces of the puzzle from HP can benefit them.

The good news for HP, according to Donatelli, is that its existing business in x86 servers, of which it takes home about a third of the industry's revenue every year, is not going away; enterprises still want conventional servers for traditional workloads. But for the Internet market, also known as the "" scale out"" market, because clusters of servers are proliferating in high volume, the Moonshot machines can be sold at a higher profit margin for HP than the x86 gear.

Donatelli got into the topic of "" software-defined networking,"" where, he points out, the company is already shipping product that's making the theory a reality. HBO, for example, is using HP's technology to program new remote-access methods for employees connecting through the ""cloud,"" rather than through traditional remote access and VPN means. And European research institute CERN is using it to load-balance across clusters of systems.

HP has support for "" open flow,"" the new ""operating system"" of data switches, if you will, an open source project developed at Stanford. HP has productized -- there's that word again -- the separation between networking control plane and data plane. And, the third element, HP has produced the "" application programming interfaces,"" or APIs, that allow customers to do novel things with switches, as in the HBO example.

In comparison, Donatelli deems the approach of VMware ( VMW), which last year bought soft-networking startup Nicira, as relatively limited and underdeveloped. He thinks Cisco Systems ( CSCO) has yet to really define what it means by software-defined networking.

And what comes next? Think about it, says Donatelli: from all the way back in the early days of mainframe computing, the bottleneck, the gating factor, has always been computer memory.

""So, you've always had to have memory outside the computer, you've always had to page out. What happens when you can have lots of non-volatile memory in the system. It's just like main memory, but it's non-volatile, and it can hold everything?""

"" Memristor,"" I offer, the name of HP's special non-volatile memory project that is not NAND flash but something else entirely. ""Yes!"" he says, his eyes getting big. It will change everything in the next ten years, he says. When will it ship? I ask, half seriously. ""It will, it will,"" he replied, though he couldn't be more specific.

The bottom line for Donatelli, when it comes to the turnaround under CEO Meg Whitman, is that doubters are wrong to question the sheer level of R&D spending at HP, either relative to the company's revenue or relative to competitors' research spending. ""It's about what gets actually turned into product,"" says Donatelli. ""At the end of the day, it's all about having the products."" The emphasis on taking HP Labs innovation and making it product, has gained momentum under Whitman, he contends.

Then, knowing where to place bets -- which bits of science and engineering will produce great product -- is a large part of the battle, says Donatelli.

HP shares today fell 4 cents to $21.93.

When will it ship, I asked, half seriously. ""It will, it will,"" he replied, though he couldn't be more specific.

First was the mainframe, from the 1960s to the middle 1980s. Then came client server computing, and Donatelli points out HP was the first to commercialize x86 servers, starting in 1989. ""People back then thought it was crazy; who would ever want to use PC technology for servers,"" he observes.

Now, the third wave will be ""convergence,"" and ""converged infrastructure, "" a term HP coined, he maintains, that many others have copied. Donatelli overseas not just servers, but also the company's networking and storage capabilities. He concedes that so far, numbers for storage and networking and server don't necessarily reflect cross-polination in customer accounts. But you will start to see that, he told me. Customers are starting already to buy with an eye to how getting multiple pieces of the puzzle from HP can benefit them.

The good news for HP, according to Donatelli, is that its existing business in x86 servers, of which it takes home about a third of the industry's revenue every year, is not going away; enterprises still want conventional servers for traditional workloads. But for the Internet market, also known as the "" scale out"" market, because clusters of servers are proliferating in high volume, the Moonshot machines can be sold at a higher profit margin for HP than the x86 gear.

Donatelli got into the topic of "" software-defined networking,"" where, he points out, the company is already shipping product that's making the theory a reality. HBO, for example, is using HP's technology to program new remote-access methods for employees connecting through the ""cloud,"" rather than through traditional remote access and VPN means. And European research institute CERN is using it to load-balance across clusters of systems.

HP has support for "" open flow,"" the new ""operating system"" of data switches, if you will, an open source project developed at Stanford. HP has productized -- there's that word again -- the separation between networking control plane and data plane. And, the third element, HP has produced the "" application programming interfaces,"" or APIs, that allow customers to do novel things with switches, as in the HBO example.

In comparison, Donatelli deems the approach of VMware ( VMW), which last year bought soft-networking startup Nicira, as relatively limited and underdeveloped. He thinks Cisco Systems ( CSCO) has yet to really define what it means by software-defined networking.

And what comes next? Think about it, says Donatelli: from all the way back in the early days of mainframe computing, the bottleneck, the gating factor, has always been computer memory.

""So, you've always had to have memory outside the computer, you've always had to page out. What happens when you can have lots of non-volatile memory in the system. It's just like main memory, but it's non-volatile, and it can hold everything?""

"" Memristor,"" I offer, the name of HP's special non-volatile memory project that is not NAND flash but something else entirely. ""Yes!"" he says, his eyes getting big. It will change everything in the next ten years, he says. When will it ship? I ask, half seriously. ""It will, it will,"" he replied, though he couldn't be more specific.

The bottom line for Donatelli, when it comes to the turnaround under CEO Meg Whitman, is that doubters are wrong to question the sheer level of R&D spending at HP, either relative to the company's revenue or relative to competitors' research spending. ""It's about what gets actually turned into product,"" says Donatelli. ""At the end of the day, it's all about having the products."" The emphasis on taking HP Labs innovation and making it product, has gained momentum under Whitman, he contends.

Then, knowing where to place bets -- which bits of science and engineering will produce great product -- is a large part of the battle, says Donatelli.

HP shares today fell 4 cents to $21.93.

When will it ship, I asked, half seriously. ""It will, it will,"" he replied, though he couldn't be more specific.

66,JOENG00020151012ebac002fd,Dell Inc. The Watershed Treatment Programs Implement Hybrid Flash Storage and Private Cloud Powered by Dell; Improves Access to Information to Enhance Patient Care,"2015 OCT 12 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Journal of Engineering -- Dell announced that The Watershed Addiction Treatment Programs, which operate inpatient and outpatient treatment centers in Florida and Texas, have doubled the access speed to its applications and data by replacing its enterprise storage infrastructure with a new Dell Storage hybrid flash array. The Watershed also has deployed virtualization using Microsoft Hyper-V for their private cloud environment, which is based on Dell servers, storage and networking technologies. As a result of the new IT, The Watershed employees have faster access to patient information and can spend more time on patient care.","For nearly two decades, The Watershed has helped more than 35,000 people with addiction recovery. Each day, more than 600 employees-including nurses, physicians, psychiatrists, paramedics and behavioral health professionals-use devices to view updated patient health information and share it with other professionals across the organization's nine locations. However, as the organization grew, giving those employees fast access to the patient database became a major challenge due to a slow, aging IT environment that sometimes experienced system outages.

To address the challenge, The Watershed wanted to deploy a full end-to-end solution from a single vendor that could quickly support the entirety of its needs with a high performing and cost-efficient solution.

""What we do here all comes down to treating addiction and saving lives,"" said Christopher Crosby, chief executive officer at The Watershed Treatment Programs. ""All of our efforts are focused on that, and if technology gets in the way, we can't accomplish our mission. We're able to remove technology as a barrier by using an end-to-end Dell solution. Technology is now a facilitator that enables us to increase the number of patients we can support and, more importantly, the quality of care we can give.""

The organization deployed a hybrid flash storage solution, based on Dell Storage SC8000 controllers and SC220 enclosures, which feature Dell Data Progression intelligent data placement technology that optimizes storage costs by automating where data is stored between different types of high performing flash drives and lower cost hard disk drives. This allows The Watershed to have critical databases and Citrix environments run primarily on faster performing flash storage while ""colder"" and archival data moves to lower cost drives. The Watershed also deployed Dell Networking N3048 and N4032 switches for performance and low latency.

The Watershed deployed a private cloud based on eight clustered Dell PowerEdge R920 rack servers, each with 1TB of RAM, as well as Dell's OpenManage systems management portfolio. With a server built for performance, greater automation and easier management, The Watershed can better support the organization's growth plans. Before implementing their private cloud solution, The Watershed IT administrators had no method to support expansion to additional locations. The organization now knows it can grow quickly.

""Using our new private cloud infrastructure, The Watershed has been able to dramatically improve network performance. As a result, employees have faster access to critical applications,"" said Trevor McCain, Citrix administrator, The Watershed Treatment Programs. ""With the Dell private cloud, we can stream applications twice as fast as our previous solution, which enables our end users a more seamless experience in their interaction with the technology. For example, our employees can log on and get access to the network in six seconds because of the new Dell technologies we have in place, including servers, networking and storage.""

The Watershed also deployed Dell Wyse thin clients to deliver virtualized desktops for secure delivery of apps and data to the endpoint. The Wyse endpoints connect back to the organization's Citrix and Microsoft Hyper-V environments, which are supported by the Dell PowerEdge R920s and Dell Compellent Storage arrays. The organization also uses Dell Storage Live Volume, a business continuity feature, to deliver 100 percent system uptime for its patient database and other end-user applications.

""From end user devices to the data center to the treatment center, Dell's differentiated cloud solutions are providing end-to-end support to The Watershed employees, enabling them to treat patients faster with improved access to information,"" said Jim Ganthier, vice president and general manager of Engineered Solutions and Cloud at Dell. ""Dell's suite of cloud solutions, software and services provide secure and rapid access to patient information and critical applications thus delivering improvements in both the quality of patient care and increasing the number of patients The Watershed can serve.""

The Watershed partnered with Dell Implementation Services to deploy the new private cloud solution's back-end technologies, and the organization also worked with Dell Financial Services (DFS) to finance the entire end-to-end solution, from servers to storage to networking, over a period of five years. By working with DFS to finance the private cloud, The Watershed was able to manage its cash flow by spreading the payments over time.

The portal allows businesses to offer customized deals, events, customer referral, and loyalty program to their customers through their own branded app via an app container the company calls TribeFind Pro.","Zulde provides businesses with an enterprise-class mobile marketing solution that eliminates the current 4-6 month development time and extensive up-front cost of creating a mobile app. For just $99 a month per location, client companies can create their own mobile marketing apps and programs on-demand that are managed and operated in the cloud via Microsoft Azure. The resulting mobile marketing app allows every business to employ integrated mobile marketing programs for ""push"" marketing, incentive and loyalty programs, mobile coupons and to invite and reward customer referrals, without the need for an internal or external programming team.

""As mobile devices increasingly become a primary touch point for consumer promotions, Zulde has emerged as the innovation leader,"" said John Schwarzkopf, Zulde VP of Sales.

Schwarzkopf noted that consumers are currently 10 times more likely to redeem a mobile offer than a printed coupon. He also noted that 9 out of 10 mobile searches currently lead to action, and more than half lead to sales. Furthermore, spending on digital ads has increased 95% from 2012 to 2013 (a trend that is on pace to continue through 2017), with mobile ads producing far greater click through and positive brand awareness than traditional online banner ads.

""We are making it possible for merchants such as restaurants, stores, salons and businesses across virtually all vertical industries to instantly take advantage of these highly dynamic and profitable mobile marketing trends,"" Schwarzkopf added. ""Beyond this, we are making the 'five mobile marketing pillars'--mobile apps, redeemable deals, event notification, loyalty and customer referrals--even more powerful by integrating the programs together on the consumer's mobile phone, as opposed to running them as independent 'silos',"" he said.

As an added benefit, Zulde allows business clients to build customer ""tribes"" through the downloadable TribeFind Pro app container, which opens the opportunity to also market to the ""greater tribe"" of opted-in consumers who would like to receive promotional deals from all of the vendors they have included in their tribe.

259,SFCWEB0020180129ee1q0000h,"Bitcoin, ethereum can pay for home rentals through San Francisco startup","Here are two conundrums that Jonathan Chou sees: Despite the hype about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, there aren't many places to spend them. And although Airbnb, Uber and other on-demand marketplaces create wealth, much of it resides with elite investors.

In an attempt to address those issues, Chou and a group of Uber, Google and Facebook alumni are starting a San Francisco company called Bee Token that will offer a short-term rental marketplace called Beenest based on cryptocurrency. They call Beenest ""Airbnb on the blockchain,"" referring to the digital ledger that records cryptocurrency transactions.","""Blockchain is all about decentralization, giving power back to the people, removing the middleman,"" said Chou, formerly an engineering lead in Uber's security and fraud division.

Put simply, Beenest will not take a commission on rentals. Airbnb takes about a 15 percent cut, with both hosts and guests chipping in. Beenest plans to keep expenses low by using the community to handle arbitration when disputes or problems arise; arbitrators will earn tokens for their time. Reviews will help determine host and guest reputations, similar to how Airbnb works.

Beenest will charge some fees, including an optional 2 percent fee from hosts for insurance, which it says covers up to $100,000 in damages. Hosts and guests who want to pay or get paid in traditional money will pay a 3.99 percent fee.

At first, it won't be suitable for Aunt Marge's vacation visits. ""We cater heavily to the cryptocurrency audience to start; it's not as intuitive to mainstream users,"" Chou said. ""We think the new need is for people to be able to spend bitcoin currency."" But he believes cryptocurrency will become much more mainstream over time.

Beenest will start in the next couple of months with a pilot program in San Francisco, setting up a website with pictures of lodgings, calendars for selecting home-stay dates and so on. Visitors will pay with tokens rather than credit cards (although eventually the company will offer a credit card option). Users can buy the tokens from Bee Token using either bitcoin or ether, the other leading cryptocurrency.

Theoretically, as the company grows, the tokens will increase in value, allowing all participants to share in its success, Chou said. Of course, tokens — like bitcoin — could also plunge in value. ""Volatility is a problem we're also considering,"" Chou said, adding that cryptocurrency users ""inherently have a much stronger tolerance for risk.""

What about enthusiasts who view cryptocurrencies as long-term investments and don't want to spend any? ""Most people aren't willing to sell it for dollars because they think it will go up,"" Chou said. ""One thing we think they're willing to spend it on is meaningful memories and experiences.""

San Francisco has strict vacation-rental rules, requiring all hosts to register with the city. Airbnb and rival HomeAway just kicked off thousands of hosts who failed to register.

Beenest's first listings will be successful Airbnb hosts who are also crypto enthusiasts, Chou said. That will ensure that they are registered. (Once hosts have registered with the city, they can rent out their house on any service.) ""We opted for something that complies with the current status quo rather than being too adventurous,"" he said. Initially, the company will handle remitting the city's 14 percent hotel tax, although it hasn't yet decided whether it will subsidize that or add it as a surcharge.

In addition, an early listing on Beenest will be Serendipia, a North Beach communal house for digital nomads to live and work. It offers 13 bunk beds in four bedrooms with a shared kitchen, a work space/living room and the flavor of a hacker hostel. Visitors typically stay one to three months, and about 80 percent pay the monthly $1,300 rent with cryptocurrency. (By requiring 30-day minimum stays, it is exempt from city registration laws.)

Residents said they appreciate the chance to meet and socialize with like-minded people.

Like Bee Token, Serendipia's founders want a communal operation where everyone owns a piece. ""We have a common vision of people contributing to the community,"" said Liudas Mikal, co-founder and chief operations officer. He was happy to work with Beenest to find more crypto enthusiasts who want to live in San Francisco.

If Beenest spreads worldwide, it's certain to encounter the same patchwork of regulations and opposition as Airbnb. ""Looking into the regulations of every region; they're all different, which is the scary part,"" Chou said.

Based in San Francisco, Bee Token has 10 full-time employees. It's raised $10 million, mainly from angel investors and small funds, and plans to raise an additional $5 million through selling its tokens in the near future. Chou said it has more than 100,000 people on its interest wait list.

Vacation rentals are just the first step. Bee Token is keeping its technology open source and hopes that other on-demand enterprises will take advantage of it.

Analyst Keith Weiss upped his price target to 37 from 33 a share, noting that recent acquisitions should help improve its standing amid rivals such as Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW).","""(With acquisitions) Blue Coat and LifeLock, we see Symantec posting high single-digit revenue growth in fiscal 2018/19 on an organic basis and 36% operating margins in 2019 — a material improvement from Symantec's flat growth profile and 28% operating margins in December 2015,"" Weiss said in a note to clients.

Mountain View, Calif.-based Symantec acquired Blue Coat Systems in 2016 for $4.65 billion. Blue Coat Chief Executive Greg Clark became Symantec's CEO in August. Then in February, Symantec closed the purchase of LifeLock, a provider of consumer identity-theft protection services, for $2.3 billion.

""With the LifeLock and BlueCoat acquisitions, we see Symantec returning its consumer business to growth while better addressing long-term secular themes within enterprise security, such as consolidation into security platforms and increased visibility across multiple attack vectors,"" added Weiss.

Symantec on Feb. 1 reported fiscal third-quarter earnings and revenue that topped views but forecast current-quarter sales and profit below expectations.

IBD'S TAKE: Revenue growth is harder to come by for many security vendors these days as large companies reassess spending priorities. Chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which tops the IBD 50 roster of growth stocks, reported revenue growth of 38% to $6.9 billion in 2016.

The LifeLock deal is aimed at bolstering its Norton security unit. The Blue Coat acquisition put Symantec in the fast-growing cloud-access security broker market. CASB products act as a middleman between a corporate network and cloud applications hosted externally.

Symantec recently announced a $1 billion debt offering. It could make more acquisitions, says Weiss.

""We believe Symantec will focus its investments on the enterprise side of its business, adding technology that bolsters its security focused on the cloud, and endpoint detection/remediation capabilities,"" he wrote.

Symantec stock rose 2.2% to 30.66 on the stock market today. Shares in Symantec have climbed 28% in 2017.

IBD's Computer-Software Security group ranks No. 156 out of 197 industry groups.

Planned for a 2018 launch, the new solution will also support a multi-representation display option of the content creating a whole new way to retail travel content.","Buyer demand is growing for more hotel content across properties, products, amenities, and rates, and this market need is the driving force behind the development of Sabre Content Services for Lodging. Buyers and consumers of GDS content will have access to more options and a more consistent shopping experience to include the way content is displayed at the room and rate level. The goal is to provide a flexible solution that meets the needs of customers.

""As a travel technology leader with customers spanning six continents, we're identifying areas that not only cater to the growing needs of travelers but also redefine the travel experience,"" said Traci Mercer, Sabre senior vice president of lodging, ground, and sea. ""The Sabre Lodging, Ground and Sea team is committed to enhancing our portfolio of lodging options, ensuring we continue to lead the way in meeting the distribution and e-commerce needs of these customer segments.""

The solution will include the capabilities of Sabre APIs and will be incorporated across all Sabre points-of-sale: Sabre Red Workspace, GetThere and TripCase. Not only will it drive more efficiency and revenue with increased lodging choice, but for both buyers and suppliers of lodging content this solution will extend tools that improve optimization capabilities to better manage chain, property, and rate-level preferred content.

""Medidata has proven to be a collaborative partner, working tirelessly with us to help us efficiently meet the challenges of our complex oncology clinical trials.""

PharmaMar required a system that was compliant with industry standards, particularly CDISC data models, for easy integrations and data sharing with its other systems. With its commitment to the Medidata's standards-based platform, PharmaMar is now leveraging Medidata's knowledge transfer program to quickly take technology management in-house.

402,TRSN000020190502ef5100002,MINNESOTA -- PUC Asks Supreme Court to Review Charter VoIP Case,"The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission has asked the Supreme Court to review a decision by a federal appellate panel last September that upheld a lower court's ruling that Charter Advanced Services LLC's interconnected VoIP (voice-over-Internet protocol) service is an information service under the federal Telecommunications Act and that state regulation of the service is thus preempted.

In a 2-1 decision in ""Charter Advanced Services (MN) LLC; Charter Advanced Services VIII (MN) LLC, v. Nancy Lange, in her official capacity as Chair of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, et al.,"" a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for Eighth Circuit (St. Louis) ruled last year that although the FCC has thus far declined to classify VoIP as either an information service or a telecommunications service, ""the VoIP technology used by Charter Spectrum is an 'information service' under the [Communications] Act.""","In his dissent, Circuit Judge L. Steven Grasz said, ""Because I do not believe net protocol conversions qualify as information services under the federal Communications Act, I would reverse the district court's conclusion that federal law preempts state regulation of Charter's Spectrum Voice service.""

The FCC had filed an amicus curiae brief with the Eighth Circuit arguing that the PUC had overstepped its authority and that its ""sweeping assertion of regulatory authority over VoIP service threatens to disrupt the national voice services market and to address how relevant FCC orders provide more measured and appropriate mechanisms for regulating VoIP service"" (TR Daily, Oct. 30, 2017).

In December the Eighth Circuit rejected the Minnesota PUC's petition for an en banc rehearing. In February the PUC asked the Supreme Court asked for 60-day extension to May 3 for filing its petition for writ of certiorari in the case, citing the retirement of former PUC Chairman Lange in January; the retirement of the PUC's general counsel and continuing vacancy of that position; and the swearing-in of a new state attorney general in January.

In the petition for writ of certiorari filed with the Supreme Court in ""Dan M. Lipschultz, John Tuma, Matthew Schuerger, Katie J. Sieben, and Valerie Means, in their official capacities as Commissioners of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, v. Charter Advanced Services (MN) LLC; Charter Advanced Services VIII (MN) LLC,"" the Minnesota PUC said, ""In this case, the Eighth Circuit became the first circuit court to reach the VoIP classification issue. Over a strong dissent, the panel majority classified VoIP service as an information service. The majority concluded that the FCC's policy against regulating information services conflicts with and preempts state regulation of VoIP service, despite the fact that the FCC has never applied this policy to VoIP.""

The PUC said the Supreme Court should consider whether ""in the absence of an FCC decision classifying VoIP service as an information service, FCC policy can conflict with and preempt state regulation of VoIP service.""

The court should also consider ""[w]hether VoIP service is a telecommunications service or an information service, under the appropriate functional test for classification determinations from [the Supreme Court's 2005 decision in 'NCTA v.] Brand X,'"" the PUC said.

It added, ""This Court should review and reverse the Eighth Circuit for four reasons. First, the issue of whether and how states may regulate VoIP service is of extraordinary importance to the communications industry and to millions of consumers of telephone services. VoIP service is rapidly replacing traditional landline telephone service in this country. If state regulation is preempted, consumers relying on VoIP service will not be covered by the legal protections that apply to traditional landline phone service, despite the fact that the two services are functionally indistinguishable to the consumers.""

It continued, ""Second, the decision below is inconsistent with this Court's conflict preemption precedents, which require clear evidence of an actual conflict with federal agency regulations. … Because the FCC has not classified VoIP service as an information service, there is not an actual conflict between state regulation of VoIP service and the FCC's information services policy. The Eighth Circuit erred by holding otherwise.

""Third, when classifying communications services, the FCC uses a functional approach based on consumer perception, a methodology this Court has upheld. See 'Brand X,' 545 U.S. at 991-93. Charter's VoIP service is a telecommunications service under this functional approach because, to the consumer, it functions like a traditional phone service. The Eighth Circuit misclassified VoIP because it failed to follow the well-established functional approach,"" the PUC added.

""Fourth, the decision below conflicts with a Vermont Supreme Court opinion holding that some, but not all, state regulation of information services is preempted. 'In re Investigation into Regulation of Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) Services,' 70 A.3d 997, 1006-08 (Vt. 2013),"" it said. -Lynn Stanton, lynn.stanton@wolterskluwer.com mailto:lynn.stanton@wolterskluwer.com","MINNESOTA -- PUC Asks Supreme Court to Review Charter VoIP Case The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission has asked the Supreme Court to review a decision by a federal appellate panel last September that upheld a lower court's ruling that Charter Advanced Services LLC's interconnected VoIP (voice-over-Internet protocol) service is an information service under the federal Telecommunications Act and that state regulation of the service is thus preempted.

SAGINAW -- It has been a rough first half of the season for the Saginaw Spirit.

Injuries, youth and absences have played havoc on the Saginaw roster, but the Spirit have battled through adversity and enter the second half with a real of playing in the playoffs.

The Spirit closed out the first half at 15-18-3-2, but have 35 points, good for fourth place in the Western Conference's West Division. If the season ended today, Saginaw would receive the final playoff spot.

Saginaw gets a little home cooking in the season's second half with seven of 11 games in January coming at The Dow Event Center, while six of 11 games come at home in February.

The Spirit's first game of 2013 comes on the road against London, followed by seven straight home games.

International success

Spirit teammates Vincent Trocheck and Jake Paterson met on the ice as rivals Thursday in the World Junior Hockey Championships in Russia when Trocheck and Team USA avenged an early tournament loss to Team Canada with a 5-1 semifinal win.

Team Canada had beaten Team USA 2-1, but now the U.S. has a chance to play for the country's third gold medal at the WJHC against defending champion Sweden.

Trocheck tallied an assist for Team USA in the win. Paterson and Canada will play in the bronze-medal game.

Making a move

Saginaw traded goaltending prospect Lucas Peressini to the Kingston Frontenacs for a fourth-round pick in the 2014 OHL Priority Selection.

Standings

Sarnia remains in first place in the West Division at 21-13-0-3 with 45 points, holding a five-point lead over Plymouth and Sault Ste. Marie. Saginaw is in fourth place with 35 points, one point ahead of Windsor.

London (32-5-1-2) is in first place in the OHL with 67 points, ahead of Owen Sound which has 53 points. Guelph (21-11-0-4) is third in the Midwest Division with 46 points.

Belleville (21-11-3-2) holds a two-point lead in the East Division with 47 points, while Barrie (24-11-0-1) leads the Central with 49 points.

   (FROM THE WALL STREET JOURNAL 4/4/14) 
   By Shira Ovide 

Satya Nadella is pushing Microsoft Corp. to look outside of Windows. He still has work to do.","In his 60 days as Microsoft's third CEO, Mr. Nadella has accelerated the spread of company software to the 85% of computing devices not running Windows, the operating system that made it famous.

Last week, he launched a version of Microsoft's popular Office workplace software for Apple Inc.'s iPad. Microsoft also announced it will stop charging fees for its Windows software built into smartphones and smaller tablets. The move isn't likely to be a big financial hit for Microsoft, but it was a symbolic move for a company that traditionally led with Windows and makes most of its money from charging for software.

Mr. Nadella also introduced new services for companies to manage corporate documents or apps on their employees' mobile devices -- whether they are using Microsoft or competitors' devices. And Thursday, a Microsoft executive used a Mac computer to demonstrate new tools to make it easier for software pros to get their apps on Apple and Google Inc.-powered smartphones.

The flurry of changes reflects Mr. Nadella's appreciation of Microsoft's lost empire. The Windows operating system dominated the computing landscape for decades, luring programmers to write applications, from payroll tools to flight-simulator videogames, that kept Microsoft as the hub of business and personal computing.

Its hegemony was undermined by expanded capability of browsers and other Internet-delivered software, as well as the rise of mobile devices.

That opened the door to companies such as Google, Apple and Facebook Inc., which are now the power centers of the digital world. Their platforms attract developers and users like Microsoft once did.

Mr. Nadella said Wednesday that Microsoft knows it is now an underdog.

""We're going to innovate with a challenger mindset,"" he said Wednesday at a developer conference. ""We're not coming at this as some incumbent.""

Technologists use the term ""cross platform"" to describe a digital service, like Netflix or Google's Gmail, that a company designs to work on different computing devices.

Microsoft long made its Office software for Macs, for example. It has apps for its Bing search engine and note-taking service OneNote for Apple and Google-powered devices.

But the new CEO has said he is moving faster to recognize a computing world without Microsoft at its heart.

""We are absolutely committed to making our applications run what most people describe as cross platform,"" Mr. Nadella said at a press briefing last week. ""There is no holding back of anything.""

Still, even Mr. Nadella doesn't always stress a Windows-untethered company. Days after his ""cross platform"" rallying cry, Microsoft opened the three-day conference devoted to luring software developers to write applications for Windows.

* Drugmakers criticize conclusions as ""flawed""","* Report may change after public comments

By John Miller

ZURICH, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Sickle cell disease drugs made by Novartis and Global Blood Therapeutics (GBT) may not be cost effective at current prices, a draft report published on Friday suggested, widening the debate over U.S. healthcare affordability.

Novartis and GBT disputed the preliminary conclusions by the Boston-based Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER). The institute scrutinised Novartis's Adakveo and GBT's Oxbryta, both approved last year, and Emmaus Medical's Endari, to treat the inherited disease that disproportionately affects African Americans.

The finding that the costs of all three medicines would likely have to be slashed to achieve acceptable cost-effectiveness thresholds comes as Congress and U.S. President Donald Trump weigh action over high healthcare costs.

Insurers and governments use privately funded ICER's conclusions to help set reimbursement rates.

ICER said it concluded that Adakveo's annual cost should be $25,410, down from an estimated $88,000 bill, and that Oxbryta must be trimmed to $9,218 from about $84,000, to meet cost-effectiveness thresholds. Endari must be cut to $3,859 from $24,000 to be cost-effective, the group added.

""Treatment costs were the main driver of the cost-effectiveness results,"" said ICER, which is taking public comment until Feb. 20 before final publication this year.

ICER seeks to measure how many years of good health - a quality-adjusted life year, or QALY - may be gained with a new treatment, and the incremental cost for that health gain.

At the current estimated costs for Adakveo, Oxbryta and Endari, all the QALYs exceeded $1 million, ICER said, well above the $150,000 the group ordinarily considers an appropriate cost-effectiveness threshold.

Novartis countered that ICER had not appropriately weighed Adakveo's benefits, including reducing pain crises suffered by sickle cell disease (SCD) patients or potentially helping cut hospital stays.

""We look forward to gaining a better understanding of the approach ICER used to make its assessment and to helping them better understand the value of Adakveo,"" Novartis said.

'FLAWED, PREMATURE'

San Francisco-based GBT contended that ICER's review conflicts with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's goal of speeding medicines to patients.

""ICER's review is flawed, premature and risks adversely impacting access to new, potentially transformative therapies,"" GBT said.

U.S.-based Emmaus could not immediately be reached for comment.

ICER said its draft report may change based on public comments, including from drugmakers. It also acknowledged setting a drug's price may go beyond traditional measures of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, to include other, non-financial considerations.

Recent advances in treating long-neglected sickle cell disease include the three medicines reviewed by ICER and an experimental gene therapy from Bluebird Bio Inc..

Still, costs are of particular interest. More than half of the roughly 100,000 U.S. sickle cell disease patients are covered by government health insurance.

PS Now will offer choice to gamers with how they want to access content. Gamers can rent by title for specific games they are interested in, or they can choose a subscription that delivers additional value with the ability to explore and play many games available across a wide variety of genres. In addition, the service will support many popular PSN(SM )features such as online multi-player, Trophies, and messages.

""We are thrilled to deliver entertainment experiences only possible from PlayStation through our new streaming game service,"" said Andrew House, President and Group CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. ""PS Now will allow users to engage in the world of PlayStation, whether they're existing fans or have never owned a PlayStation platform.""

Sony Computer Entertainment Announces ""PlaystationNow"", A New Streaming Game Service That Leverages Cloud-Based Technology; To Be Available In The United States This Summer 2014 JAN 24 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Entertainment Newsweekly -- Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. (SCE) announced that ""PlayStation(TM)Now"" (PS Now), the company's streaming game service that leverages cloud-based technology, will become officially available in the United States this summer. PS Now will deliver a variety of popular PlayStation(R)3 (PS3(TM)) game titles(*1) first on PlayStation(R)4 (PS4(TM)) and PS3 systems, followed by the PlayStation(R)Vita (PS Vita) system.

In addition to PlayStation platforms, most 2014 U.S. models of Sony's BRAVIA(R) TV(*2) lineup will support PS Now. Eventually the service will expand beyond PlayStation platforms and Sony devices, allowing users to stream PlayStation games on numerous other Internet-connected devices. SCE's vision for PS Now is to enable users to instantly enjoy a wide range of full games on the Internet-connected consumer electronics devices they use every day. The accessibility of PS Now means, for example, that PS4 users in the living room can continue playing a game on a PS3 system in their bedroom. Or PS Vita users can enjoy instant access to a game wherever there's Wi-Fi connectivity, such as outdoors, then can switch to a supporting BRAVIA(R) TV's big screen and play the same game after arriving home.

PS Now will offer choice to gamers with how they want to access content. Gamers can rent by title for specific games they are interested in, or they can choose a subscription that delivers additional value with the ability to explore and play many games available across a wide variety of genres. In addition, the service will support many popular PSN(SM )features such as online multi-player, Trophies, and messages.

""We are thrilled to deliver entertainment experiences only possible from PlayStation through our new streaming game service,"" said Andrew House, President and Group CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. ""PS Now will allow users to engage in the world of PlayStation, whether they're existing fans or have never owned a PlayStation platform.""

During the 2014 International CES held in Las Vegas from January 7, attendees can visit the Sony booth to have a hands-on experience with the PS Now service for the first time ever. Attendees can enjoy four blockbuster PS3 titles, BEYOND: Two Souls, God of War: Ascension, The Last of Us and Puppeteer from SCE Worldwide Studios, on PS Vita or BRAVIA(R) TV.

Prior to the official launch, SCE will begin a beta program on PS3 systems in certain regions of the United States from the end of January. Additional information about PS Now will be available at http://us.playstation.com/playstationnow.

5,DJON000020130618e96i0006e,2nd UPDATE: Adobe 2nd-Quarter Profit Down 66% as Expenses Rise,"--Trial online users rapidly converting to paid subscribers

--Recurring revenue climbs to 35% of total in quarter","--Expecting 3Q Creative Cloud sub growth to exceed 2Q growth

(Updates beginning in the sixth paragraph with financial chief's comment.)


 
   By Steven D. Jones and Nathalie Tadena 
 

Adobe Systems Inc.'s (ADBE) fiscal second-quarter earnings fell 66% on higher expenses as the company accelerated its transition to online subscription services and away from periodic releases of licensed and packaged software.

The company added 18,000 subscribers every week in the last quarter to its suite of online creative tools, a pace of growth 44% faster than the prior quarter. Newcomers received a free trial period, and so far Adobe has turned 700,000 into paying subscribers with most on annual contracts.

Results ""demonstrate continued execution and momentum across our digital media and digital marketing businesses,"" Chief Executive Shantanu Narayen told analysts on the company's earnings call.

Illustrators and photographers find the constantly-updated cloud is more attractive than periodic updates of licensed software, he said. Still, more than 25,000 have signed a petition against the switch, and Mr. Narayen said ""the feedback from our community is important and we are evaluating additional options that will help them with the transition.""

Per-share earnings fell to 15 cents in the fiscal second quarter from 45 cents a year ago, a result of the rapid growth of subscription services that require the company to book some of the sale to deferred revenue to recognize in future quarters, not the current quarter.

Currently, every 1,000 customers that shift from Adobe's licensed software to its Creative Cloud shift $500,000 in revenue from the current quarter to future periods, Chief Financial Officer Mark Garrett said in an interview. Of the 12 million users of Adobe software worldwide, the company expects to move 4 million of those online by the end of 2014, and continue growing.

""I don't foresee us getting all 12 million of those people moved, but we expect to grow that number beyond 2014,"" he said.

The company also is focused on converting businesses from licensed versions of its products to online services. Consumer and enterprise subscriptions combined lifted recurring revenue to 35% of total revenue in the quarter, up from 31% in the prior quarter.

Revenue in Adobe's marketing cloud grew 17%, which was below analysts' expectations, but once again it was because of the shift to cloud, Mr. Garrett said. Several customers using Adobe Experience Manager, a Web content management tool, switched from licensed versions of the software to online service in the second quarter. Enterprises are ""even more receptive of hosted solutions"" than creative professionals, he said, which will propel the marketing cloud toward $1 billion in annual revenue.

Adobe, the maker of Photoshop and Illustrator design software for creative professionals and web marketers, is transitioning to subscription services and away from packaged software. Software-as-a-service, a subscription-based business model, offers customers more pricing options and flexibility.

Adobe also is pushing into the sector for digital marketing services with tools to measure and manage data gathered from social sites, purchases and page views. Selling the products together is compounding the utility for clients and accelerating new bookings, but current revenue for the product was $229 million, or 17% growth over a year ago, below what many analysts expected.

""Bookings growth was on target, but revenue was a bit light,"" said analyst Josh Olson of Edward Jones. ""That was the one area of potential weakness"" in the company's transition to online services.

Developers have long relied on Adobe products to create content and build sites on the web. In late 2011, Adobe surprised many by announcing its intention to move that business to subscriptions. It also decided to adopt HTML 5 for streaming media to mobile devices instead of its own Flash player, which led Adobe to cut 750 jobs in its Flash development group and take a $94 million charge.

Since then Adobe shares have climbed 66% to $45.40, which includes a 4.8% gain in after-hours trading Tuesday.

For the quarter ended May 31, Adobe reported a profit of $76.5 million, or 15 cents a share, down from $223.9 million, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest period included $25 million in restructuring charges. Excluding restructuring expenses, stock-based compensation, and other items, per-share earnings slipped to 36 cents from 60 cents. Revenue fell 10% to $1.01 billion.

The company in March had projected earnings of 29 cents to 35 cents a share on revenue of $975 million to $1.03 billion.

Product sales, still the bulk of Adobe's revenue, declined 26%, while subscription revenue jumped 60%. Revenue from services and support was up 18%.

Operating margin narrowed to 11% from 27.1% as operating expenses increased 11%.

269,J000000020171107edb70000h,Microsoft Gears Up for Videogame Turnaround,"Microsoft Corp. debuts its new Xbox One X console Tuesday, hoping a focus on live services and high-end hardware can reverse its flagging fortunes in the videogame business.

Microsoft in September named Xbox chief Phil Spencer executive vice president, reporting directly to Chief Executive Satya Nadella rather than Windows chief Terry Myerson.","In an interview, Mr. Spencer said his new role is designed, in part, to give him more latitude to reach gamers on any device, rather than using ""gaming to make Windows more successful.""

That means, one day, more Microsoft first-party games could appear on other platforms, he said, such as Apple Inc.'s iPhones or perhaps even Sony Corp.'s PlayStation 4, as its building game ""Minecraft"" does.

Mr. Spencer is overseeing the release of the $499 Xbox One X, which Microsoft hails as the most powerful console in the world. The machine enters a marketplace crowded not only with the cheaper Xbox One S, but also Sony's dominant PlayStation 4 machines and a resurgent Nintendo Co., whose popular Switch handheld-console hybrid launched this year.

The companies are vying for a share of the $33.5 billion projected to be spent on videogame console software world-wide this year, according to industry tracker Newzoo BV.

Microsoft, trailing Sony, stopped reporting Xbox One sales in late 2014, a little more than a year after its launch. Analysts believe the Xbox One still lags behind in sales today.

Mr. Spencer acknowledged console sales are important, but said Microsoft is more focused on expanding game software and services. He said the company measures the success of its gaming business by revealing the number of people who use its online service Xbox Live, for example.

In its fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30, Xbox Live had 53 million monthly active users, up 13% from a year earlier, Microsoft said. Overall gaming revenue, though, inched up 1% to $1.9 billion, as a 48% drop in hardware sales offset a 21% gain in software and services.

Microsoft hopes to lure shoppers this holiday by bringing one of the hottest games of the year -- ""PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds"" -- to the Xbox One.

Previewed today at Oracle OpenWorld, Mobile Application Accelerator, a new capability in Oracle Mobile Cloud Service, enables nontechnical staff to build their own mobile applications.

Oracle’s Mobile Application Accelerator feature allows users with no coding experience to rapidly and intuitively produce mobile applications without coding.

Mobile Application Accelerator provides an instant, live view of the application even while editing, without requiring the typical development and release cycles. No deployment step is required.

The new mobile capability allows users to develop secure, user friendly, and engaging mobile applications that run on both iOS and Android phones and tablets by leveraging Oracle Mobile Application Framework and Oracle Mobile Cloud, part of the Oracle Cloud .

The Mobile Application Accelerator development environment offers the ability to develop mobile applications from both desktops and mobile devices without the need to install mobile development environments.

By giving new classes of professionals the power to create mobile applications, Mobile Application Accelerator reduces users’ ever-increasing demands on IT for mobile access to data and processes.

Based on a set of best practices for UI design, Mobile Application Accelerator makes it possible for users to create mobile applications leveraging multiple page templates and connect them to various back-end systems with Oracle Mobile Cloud.

Developers can use Oracle Mobile Application Framework to further enhance mobile applications created with Mobile Application Accelerator. This capability provides continuity of development tools and framework between power users and developers and increases collaboration.

(Wappingers Falls, NY); Blake, Michael A. (Wappingers Falls, NY); Fee, Michael (Cold Spring, NY); Huynh, Hieu T. (Austin, NY); Meaney, Patrick J. (Poughkeepsie, NY); O'Neill, Arthur J. (Poughkeepsie, NY), filed on March 7, 2013, was published online on July 21, 2015, according to news reporting originating from Alexandria, Virginia, by VerticalNews correspondents.

Patent number 9086990 is assigned to International Business Machines Corporation (Armonk, NY).","The following quote was obtained by the news editors from the background information supplied by the inventors: ""The present invention relates generally to memory in a computing system, and more specifically, to handling errors in memory.

""Computer systems often have a considerable amount of cache and high speed random access memory (RAM) to hold information, such as data and programs, temporarily when a computer is powered and operational. This information is normally binary, composed of patterns of 1's and 0's known as bits of data. The bits of data are often grouped and organized at a higher level. A byte, for example, is typically composed of 8 bits; more generally these groups or bytes are called symbols and may consist of any number of bits or sub-symbols.

""Memory device densities have continued to grow as computer systems have become more powerful. Unfortunately, the failure of just a portion of a memory device, such as a cache or RAM, can lead to significantly reduced performance. When memory errors occur, which may be 'hard' (repeating) or 'soft' (one-time or intermittent) failures, these failures may occur as single cell, multi-bit, wordline or bitlines and may cause all or part of the memory device to be unusable until it is repaired.

""In the case of failures in a cache, a failure of a bitline is a hard error that causes errors each time a line that includes the failed bitline is accessed. In some cases, the failed bitline, in addition to a correctable error (CE) in the same line, will result in an uncorrectable two bit error (UE). Thus, cache performance is adversely affected by a failed bitline, as it may cause CEs that would ordinarily be quickly corrected by ECC to require additional processes to access the correct data or result in corrupted data.""

In addition to the background information obtained for this patent, VerticalNews journalists also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: ""Embodiments include a method, system, and computer program product including detecting a first error when reading a first cache line in an array within a cache, recording a first bitline address and a first wordline address of the first error in the first cache line, detecting a second error when reading a second cache line in the array within the cache and recording a second bitline address and a second wordline address of the second error in the second cache line. Embodiments also include comparing the first bitline address to the second bitline address, comparing the first wordline address to the second wordline address, activating, by a cache controller, a bitline delete mode based on the first bitline address matching the second bitline address and the first wordline address not matching the second wordline address and detecting a third error when reading a third cache line in the array within the cache. Embodiments further include recording a third bitline address of the third error in the third cache line, comparing the second bitline address to a third bitline address of the third cache line and deleting, by the cache controller, a location corresponding to the third cache line from available cache locations based on the activated bitline delete mode and the third bitline address matching the second bitline address.""

22,ECOCOM0020130806e9850000f,The business of sailing; The Oracle of San Francisco Bay,"Larry Ellison deserves encouragement in his bid to remake the America's Cup

THE Olympics have long been the king of unprofitable sporting boondoggles. In recent years, however, sailing';s America';s Cup has given the Summer Games a run for their (lack of) money. The 2012 Olympics in London defied expectations and actually broke even on a budget of $14 billion. By contrast, the 2007 and 2010 America';s Cups in Valencia, Spain generated just $1.7 billion in revenue, against $4.3 billion of costs. The 12 teams that sought to qualify each spent around $100m to prepare, which was mostly raised from corporate sponsors and used to pay salaries. The regional government then sunk some $3 billion into new infrastructure, including building a new marina and dredging a channel. In 2012 Valencia became the first of Spain';s 17 regions to ask for a federal bailout.","Among the many quirks of the 162-year-old America';s Cup is that the reigning champions get to select the venue and rules for their title defence. The victor in 2010 was Team Oracle, led by Larry Ellison, the boss of the Oracle software company and the world';s fifth-richest man. Mr Ellison certainly knows how to make a profit in the business world. For the 2013 contest, which begins on September 7th, he implicitly set a goal far more daunting than simply securing another trophy as the world';s finest sailor: making the America';s Cup financially viable.

The most striking of Mr Ellison';s tweaks was the introduction of a new type of boat, the AC72. Rather than traditional plodding sailboats, this year';s contestants will race two-hulled catamarans, which can hover above the water on hydrofoils in healthy winds and attain speeds of over 40 knots (46 miles or 74 km) per hour—some four times faster than their predecessors. The boats can also sail far closer to land because of their shallow drafts. That will allow spectators to watch the race in person from shore. In the past, only fans fortunate enough to have access to a private yacht could catch a glimpse of the boats, which contributed to the perception that the race was of interest only to millionaire yacht owners and their billionaire corporate sponsors.

The second big change was moving the Cup from Valencia to Mr Ellison';s hometown of San Francisco. The event';s organisers have long struggled with “wind delays”—unpredictably long periods in which the boats float aimlessly and viewers have nothing to watch. In the blowy San Francisco Bay, by contrast, consistent gusts should keep the competitors moving at all times. That in turn facilitated a new business strategy. Because sailing has historically made for bad television, there was little market for the broadcast rights to the Cup in the United States. The event';s organisers were sufficiently confident that this time would be different that they spent proceeds from foreign broadcast rights and sponsorships to have the event televised on the free-to-air channel NBC. They hope to recoup that cost and more by selling commercials.

The journey has proven far bumpier than Mr Ellison had hoped. The biggest setback was an awful accident involving the new vessels, which are much harder to control than single-hulled boats. On May 9th a Swedish Artemis Racing catamaran capsized and broke apart while turning during a training session. Andrew Simpson, a British Olympic gold medallist, drowned after being trapped under the fragments for around ten minutes.

Simpson';s tragic death not only left a cloud over the competition but also wound up sowing discord among the competitors. In response to the disaster, the director of the race made a series of recommendations to modify the boats and improve safety. The Italian team, Luna Rossa, protested that it did not have time to implement these changes and staged a long boycott. The head of Team Oracle, Russell Coutts, retorted that the Italians were “a bunch of spoiled rich kids dressed in Prada gear.”

Relations with corporate sponsors have also come under strain. One of the event';s principal backers is Louis Vuitton, the luxury-goods maker that has lent its name to the qualifying race for the America';s Cup since 1983. The firm ponied up $10m, expecting that as many as 12 teams would compete and requiring a minimum of six. But only three wound up racing, leading the company to demand a $3m refund.

Finally, the organisers'; dealings with the host city have been far from smooth sailing. Environmental groups filed a lawsuit demanding a stricter, more thorough review of the event';s potential impact on the bay than the original study, and plans for an enormous floating television monitor were scrapped over concerns that it would interfere with swimmers. Municipal officials originally projected that the race would generate $1.4 billion of economic activity and 8,800 new jobs; it has since trimmed those expectations to $900m and 6,500. And the San Francisco government has raised just half of the $32m in donations it thought would be necessary to cover its direct costs for putting on the race, though it now plans to spend just $22m.

The bad press caused by all these missteps has generated a perception that Mr Ellison';s Cup has veered far off course. But it is far too early to write off his effort to remake the event. Some 40,000 people have already turned out to watch the preliminary races, an achievement all by itself in a city where 70% of residents say they have no relation with the waterfront. The government';s projection that the event will attract an additional 2m tourists, on top of the 5-6m it usually draws during the summer, might prove to be optimistic. But even a fraction of that would cover the city';s hosting costs with room to spare. And three-quarters of the commercial space on NBC has already been sold. Even the string of bad headlines has probably increased awareness of the Cup among people who had never heard of it previously.

Because most public scrutiny has focused on the new format of the race, the actual outcome of the competition has attracted little attention. Of course, even if the event meets its financial goals, its reform could easily be reversed if Team Oracle is defeated and a new champion decides to revert to the Cup';s traditional configuration. The spectators who line up along the San Francisco Bay to watch the catamarans zip by should probably cheer for a successful title defence by Oracle if they hope to see the race in person again.","The business of sailing; The Oracle of San Francisco Bay Larry Ellison deserves encouragement in his bid to remake the America's Cup

THE Olympics have long been the king of unprofitable sporting boondoggles. In recent years, however, sailing';s America';s Cup has given the Summer Games a run for their (lack of) money. The 2012 Olympics in London defied expectations and actually broke even on a budget of $14 billion. By contrast, the 2007 and 2010 America';s Cups in Valencia, Spain generated just $1.7 billion in revenue, against $4.3 billion of costs. The 12 teams that sought to qualify each spent around $100m to prepare, which was mostly raised from corporate sponsors and used to pay salaries. The regional government then sunk some $3 billion into new infrastructure, including building a new marina and dredging a channel. In 2012 Valencia became the first of Spain';s 17 regions to ask for a federal bailout. Among the many quirks of the 162-year-old America';s Cup is that the reigning champions get to select the venue and rules for their title defence. The victor in 2010 was Team Oracle, led by Larry Ellison, the boss of the Oracle software company and the world';s fifth-richest man. Mr Ellison certainly knows how to make a profit in the business world.

Today's Screen Of The Day is Big Cap Leaders, quality stocks with a market capitalization of at least $10 billion.","A second sort shows the top five Big Caps that went public within the last three years. Big stock winners typically went public within the last several years, often with new products or services in hot fields.

In addition to Facebook, LinkedIn and Qihoo 360 Technology, Michael Kors (KORS) and TripAdvisor (TRIP) also are on this twice-filtered list.

Facebook is far and away the largest social network with more than 1 billion users. Its stock jumped 29% on July 25, a day after it crushed second-quarter earnings forecasts on huge mobile gains. Last Thursday, founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the launch of Internet.org, a partnership with mobile device maker Samsung and others to bring Web access to the two-thirds of the world's population without it.

Facebook stock, up 50% since July 24, fell 4.1% in the stock marketTuesday as equities sold off worldwide on fears of U.S. military action in Syria. Facebook hit a closing high Monday.

In the business arena, LinkedIn is the top social network, linking professionals with each other and with companies searching for employees. The company last week unveiled its new University Pages, and opened its network to college-minded high school students. It lowered the minimum age limit for U.S. users to 14 from 18, and to 13 in most other countries starting Sept. 12. Shares slid 2.7% Tuesday after hitting a record high Monday.

China's Qihoo 360 jumped 8% on Monday after its second-quarter profit and revenue more than doubled from a year ago, smashing analyst estimates. Qihoo's investments in online search technology to take on Chinese search leader Baidu (BIDU) are paying off, analysts said, as Qihoo approaches a 20% market share. Qihoo edged a little higher on Tuesday to fresh records, but shares fell 4% late after the company announced a plan to sell $550 million in convertible debt.

Michael Kors seems never to go out of style. Consumers like the company's trendy luxury apparel and accessories. Amid strong, growing global sales, its stock price has risen 256% from its $20 initial offering on Dec. 16, 2011, to a close of 71.23 Tuesday, down nearly 2% for the day.

Like peers Priceline.com (PCLN) and former parent Expedia (EXPE), TripAdvisor is benefiting from renewed consumer and business travel as the world gradually recovers from the Great Recession. It's taken a bit of a ride lately though as shares climbed 34% in three weeks from July 24 to Aug. 12, then fell 9% on Aug. 14 after CEO Steve Kaufer cautioned at an investment conference that summer travel trends have been weaker than expected.

TripAdvisor fell 1.6% Tuesday.

The patent's assignee is Vonage Network Llc.","News editors obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: ""Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to applications which generate predictable and repetitive text lines in their log files such as voice over internet protocol (VoIP) applications, networking and reporting applications or the like, and more specifically, to a method and apparatus for optimizing log file filtering.

""Element Management Systems (EMS) provide a means to monitor networked elements such as servers, gateway devices, and all elements which generate predictable and repetitive text lines in log files. The purpose of an application's log file(s) is to provide insight into the application's activity, especially when the application records critical events such as failures or any event which requires immediate attention in the log file(s). EMS's usually include an agent which reads each new line of a log file and runs it through multiple filters in order to match the line and identify the line so that the proper information is forwarded to the EMS which then generates an alert related to that line.

""When troubleshooting, engineers or administrators often need to perform a search through the log files which store information regarding events related to a server or an application. In order to investigate an event or an error, all log files from various servers are processed against a set of filters, previously defined by the engineers, to target errors or error conditions. However, processing multiple large log files from many servers against a large list of filters to produce matching events becomes inefficient and time-consuming, deteriorating network and server performance, and negatively impacting customer satisfaction.

RBFCU is one the fastest growing credit unions in the nation according to data from the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). It has won recognition for its financial stability and outstanding performance, including six consecutive Crystal Performance Awards from Raddon Financial Group, three consecutive A+ ratings from Weiss Ratings, 91 consecutive ""superior"" rankings from Bauer Financial, four consecutive Fast Track Company growth awards from the San Antonio Business Journal and top-ten rankings from both SNL Financial and IDC Financial Publishing.
