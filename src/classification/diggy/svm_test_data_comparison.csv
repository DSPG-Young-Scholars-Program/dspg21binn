343,INVDAI0020131204e9c400014,"Fiber Optics Maker Finisar Surfs Long Wave Of Data Demand FINISAR Sunnyvale, California","After revving up investor enthusiasm with a solid first quarter and bright prospects, fiber optics firm Finisar suffered a stock-market setback when roughly two months later Cisco Systems, its biggest customer, sent out a warning of slower days ahead.

And while Wall Street expects Finisar (FNSR) to post another triple-digit profit gain when it reports second-quarter results on Thursday after the close, the company's stock has yet to recover much of its lost ground.","Finisar is a leading supplier of components for fiber-optic networks. Its technologies enable high-speed voice, video and data communications in telecommunications, networking, storage, wireless and cable TV applications.

After eight straight quarters of earnings declines, Finisar hit the comeback trail in its first quarter of fiscal 2014, reported on Sept. 5. Earnings soared 158% year over year to 31 cents a share and sales rose 21% to $266.1 million.

Demand For Bandwidth

""Finisar's revenue was driven primarily by growth in the world demand for bandwidth, for the ever-increasing distribution and use of video, images and digital information,"" said Executive Chairman Jerry Rawls on the first-quarter conference call.

In the wake of the report — during which Finisar also raised second-quarter guidance — Finisar's shares climbed 15% in the week ended Sept. 6.

But the tide turned after networking gear leader Cisco (CSCO), from which Finisar derives a substantial chunk of revenue, gave a disappointing outlook for its current quarter and missed analyst revenue estimates in its first quarter of fiscal 2014, reported on Nov. 13.

Finisar's shares sank 7% on Nov. 14.

""The stock was down so much because Cisco is their top customer at 17% of its fiscal 2013 revenue, and Cisco's guidance was really bad,"" said MKM Partners analyst Michael Genovese.

But Genovese is still upbeat about Finisar's second quarter.

""I still think their October quarter will have strong earnings,"" he said. ""Cisco has become less of a driver for Finisar. The Web 2.0 customers like Google (GOOG) and Amazon.com (AMZN) are driving the growth at Finisar, not Cisco.""

He expects Finisar to report a ""good"" second quarter and guidance for the January quarter to be ""in line"" with consensus.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see second-quarter earnings rising 160% to 39 cents a share. They expect full-year earnings to climb 122% to $1.42 a share.

William Blair & Co. analyst Dmitry Netis says Finisar will ""likely print a solid second quarter.""

""But I'm cautious into the January and April quarters,"" he said.

He cites annual price negotiations and the ""macro impact in Europe and China as raised by Cisco, which may put the brakes on a telecom segment ramp-up,"" as the reasons for his caution.

Finisar makes optical transmission modules that go into telecom and datacom applications. It sells mainly to manufacturers of storage systems, networking equipment and telecom equipment, such as Alcatel-Lucent S.A. (ALU), Brocade Communications Systems (BRCD), Cisco and Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)

Data Traffic Growth

Finisar is benefiting from a few trends, says Genovese.

""The biggest is the growth in data traffic, which is the biggest ever since the advent of Internet,"" he said.

Global data traffic, he says, is growing over 50% a year, which in turn is driving the demand for added optical transmission capacity.

Finisar's datacom business has been the driver of its recent growth spurt. Two or three years ago, the percentage of sales was split equally between that and telecom. Now, about 70% is from datacom and around 30% is from telecom amid faster growth on the datacom side, says Genovese.

The datacom business ""has massively accelerated"" in the last two quarters overall and for Finisar, says Genovese.

In its first quarter, Finisar's sales of products for datacom applications rose 12.5% over the prior quarter, while sales of products for telecom applications rose 2.7%.

What's driving the strength in datacom?

""Companies like Google and Amazon are building bigger and bigger data centers and upgrading their older centers,"" said Genovese. ""There's been a lot of investment in datacom.""

That investment should continue, wrote Craig-Hallum Capital Group analyst Richard Shannon in a report following Finisar's first-quarter results.

""We believe the datacom spending trends have good visibility for at least the next couple of quarters, driven by the transition to 10G (10-gigabit data communication networks) in mainstream enterprise and 40G/100G in larger data center builds,"" he wrote. Finisar is ""well-positioned with multiple products that will bolster the continued growth in datacom (and) should continue to benefit from strong 10G momentum with its Ethernet transceivers.""

Telecom Growth

Things could be looking up for Finisar on the telecom side, which had been weak.

""While telecom has been slow to return to a growth path, we think trends are slightly improving,"" Shannon wrote. Among the reasons is ""reiterated"" capital spending guidance by the three main Chinese telecom companies, suggesting ""strong spending patterns"" for the second half of 2013.

Rawls also sees an uptick on the telecom front in the second quarter: ""We expect the growth rate for telecom to accelerate, and both datacom and telecom revenues to increase over the first quarter,"" he said on the first-quarter conference call.","Fiber Optics Maker Finisar Surfs Long Wave Of Data Demand FINISAR Sunnyvale, California After revving up investor enthusiasm with a solid first quarter and bright prospects, fiber optics firm Finisar suffered a stock-market setback when roughly two months later Cisco Systems, its biggest customer, sent out a warning of slower days ahead.

305,UWIR000020191025efao0007s,WiFi Dreaming: App Publishers Amend Privacy Practices,"James Madison University ; Harrisonburg, VA - news

By","ARLINGTON, Va., Oct. 24, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- The Digital Advertising Accountability Program released the results of two reviews of popular mobile apps that allowed ad tech companies to collect device and behavioral data from their users without first meeting industry privacy standards. Both companies, WiFi Map LLC and Ipnos Software Inc., eagerly adopted the Accountability Program's recommendations and came into compliance with the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles.

The BBB National Programs' Accountability Program examines popular mobile apps for compliance with the DAA Principles, which chiefly focus on providing extra insight into and options about targeted online ads. In the course of its monitoring efforts, the consumer privacy program developed concerns with WiFi Map and Ipnos's Relax Melodies.

""These app publishers obviously care a lot about their apps, and they want to do the right thing for their users. But in both cases, we noticed that some privacy issues had made it out of development and into production,"" said Jon Brescia, VP of the Accountability Program. ""Once we got in touch, both Ipnos and WiFi Map really demonstrated that they were highly responsible and user-focused, and they implemented all of our recommendations in record time.""

Don't Doze on Data Privacy

Ipnos is a Canadian wellness app developer whose products focus on healthful activities like meditation, relaxation, and improving sleep. While examining Ipnos's app, Relax Melodies, the Accountability Program found ad tech companies collecting unique IDs to facilitate ad targeting. But the app lacked up-front, or ""enhanced,"" notice of this fact, and its privacy disclosures didn't explain how consumers could opt out of targeted ads. Consequently, the Accountability Program reached out to Ipnos with questions about its observations.

Once contacted, Ipnos acknowledged the Accountability Program's test results and immediately committed to full compliance with the DAA Principles. The company updated its privacy policy to include an enhanced notice jump link and an opt-out tool, all accessible from the privacy links in its app store listings and app settings menus. Now, users of Ipnos's apps have knowledge about targeted advertising that occurs as a result of their app usage.

Ipnos's case demonstrates the global interoperability of the DAA Principles, expressed in this instance by a Canadian company—subject to Canadian privacy laws—adopting the best practices embodied in this code. This is further proof that the core concepts of transparency and choice can be applied to across national barriers, adapting to the new regulatory contours presented by each jurisdiction.

Maps & Legends

Today's second case concerns the mobile hotspot crowdsourcing app WiFi Map, produced by a company of the same name. The Accountability Program discovered online ad companies collecting device IDs and extremely precise geospatial coordinates through the app. The app did the responsible thing and asked for users to provide consent for the collection of the location data, but the disclosure never mentioned that third parties might get the data for ad purposes. WiFi Map's privacy disclosures also did not describe an easy-to-use mobile opt-tool, and the company did not provide any enhanced notice links for IBA or location data collection. After learning of these issues, WiFi Map quickly worked with the Accountability Program to remedy them by:

Updating its privacy policy to include an enhanced notice jump link that takes users to information about IBA

Updating its notices to provide consumer opt-out tools

Engineering a patch to its mobile app to provide users with robust up-front disclosures, specifically including ad partners' use of location data for IBA

Adding a statement of adherence to the DAA Principles to its privacy policy

These changes more than eliminated the Accountability Program's concerns and brought WiFi Map into full compliance with the DAA Principles.

If the Accountability Program's 107 prior actions weren't enough of an indication, today's cases—the 14th so far this year—demonstrate that this privacy enforcer is always combing the internet for compliance concerns.

Companies would do well to review their privacy policies and practices—particularly around sensitive data like location—and to reach out to the Accountability Program before it contacts you.

Snap Inc. on Sunday said it has followed a request from the Saudi Arabian government to block access to Al Jazeera news articles and videos on its Snapchat social-media app to residents in the country.","Al Jazeera’s Arabic-language channel in Snapchat Discover, which had been available since May, was removed from the Saudi Arabian version of the app, a spokeswoman from Snap said. Al Jazeera articles remain open to Snapchat users in 14 other countries in the Middle East.

Snap’s (SNAP, US)  decision could inflame tensions between the Qatari broadcaster and the four neighboring countries that have imposed an economic blockade on Qatar. In a statement, a spokesman for Al Jazeera said Snap’s move appears to be “an attempt to silence freedom of expression.”

Qatari businesses are facing pressure after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt abruptly broke diplomatic ties with the nation in June, accusing it of sheltering and supporting Islamist groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas, claims which Qatar denies.

Snap’s (SNAP, US)  decision could inflame tensions between the Qatari broadcaster and the four neighboring countries that have imposed an economic blockade on Qatar. In a statement, a spokesman for Al Jazeera said Snap’s move appears to be “an attempt to silence freedom of expression.”

Qatari businesses are facing pressure after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt abruptly broke diplomatic ties with the nation in June, accusing it of sheltering and supporting Islamist groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas, claims which Qatar denies.

- Dragontail Systems Uses Advanced AI and ML Technology to Optimize Operations and Enforce Food Safety Standards","Dragontail Systems Limited (ASX: DTS), a software company that optimizes the entire restaurant order and delivery process for global brands like Dominos and Pizza Hut, has announced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that it is updating its patented AI-based computer-vision quality management system, the QT AI camera, to detect cleanliness and sanitation. These enhancements are announced in conjunction with the company's launch into the U.S. market and opening of an official New York office.

In addition to monitoring key elements during the preparation and packing process, including the quality and accuracy of ingredients and temperature of the food, these enhancements specifically introduced to combat the spread of coronavirus will detect the presence of gloves and masks, and how often equipment and workspaces are sanitized and replaced. This information is closely monitored by managers and can be shared with the customer so as to ensure service compliance with defined quality standards.

""Dragontail Systems' technology will empower fast-food services and restaurants of any size to address the growing concern of health and safety during the coronavirus pandemic,"" said Ido Levanon, CEO and Director of Dragontail Systems. ""Our unique AI camera already helps hundreds of stores recognize even the smallest of errors often undetected by the human eye, for example pizza toppings above and below the cheese, or even the food's temperature. Now we are upgrading our technology to monitor processes that may lead to virus spread or contamination. In doing so, we expect to develop more impactful insights that foster transparency and ensure quality standards set by the businesses and the end-customer.""

The new QT AI Camera, in conjunction with Dragontail's Algo Dispatching Systems, fully optimizes and automates the kitchen and dispatching flow, including order receipt and kitchen prioritization for meal preparation, as well as food packing, dispatch, route management, and delivery. By optimizing the entire restaurant operation, Dragontail Systems can turn any restaurant into a delivery powerhouse within just a couple of days.

""The food industry needs an edge-complete solution that is specially customized with the end product in mind. Our system is designed to take on the role of the super manager, processing every relevant data point inside and outside the restaurant and taking into consideration multiple variables such as number of orders and locations of customers and drivers, in order to optimize decisions at every point in the supply chain. This enables us to work directly with our customers to find more ways to streamline operations while bringing in more business, guaranteeing meals arrive hot and fresh, reducing costs and increasing repeat-customers,"" continued Dragontail's CEO.

At all times, the system enables real-time employee management that drives critical business decisions while calculating relevant variables that lead to more accurate and faster deliveries, as well as improvements in customer satisfaction and food quality and safety, all of which impact the bottom line. The system is versatile outside of the foodservice industry and can be utilized in a number of other verticals, including hotel room service, airline catering, supermarket delivery, same day couriers and technician dispatch.

The latest stable version of Microsoft’s Edge browser finally adds support for extension syncing, meaning you won’t have to manually re-install extensions individually with each new device. Microsoft teased the feature as part of its Build announcement earlier this week, but the update log for the browser’s latest version (83.0.478.37, to be exact) confirms that it’s rolling out now.","Alongside support for extension sync, the latest version of Edge includes a host of other improvements. You can now exempt certain cookies from automatically clearing when the browser closes (useful if there’s a particular website that you want to stay logged into), and Edge’s Collections feature now supports drag and drop to make it easier to save web pages and clippings. The browser can also now prompt you to switch profiles if you’re visiting a site that needs to be authenticated using a separate school or work profile. Check out the full list of improvements on Microsoft’s site.

Alongside improvements to Collections

Extension sync was just one of the Edge features teased by Microsoft in its Build announcement earlier this week. Other highlights include a new sidebar search feature that lets you search the web without leaving your current tab, as well as Pinterest integration for Collections. Conspicuously missing, however, is full history and tab syncing, which are present in competitors like Chrome.

Although Microsoft’s release notes say that the latest version of the browser came out on May 21st, it might be a few days before the update reaches everyone.

217,INVDAI0020170323ed3m00019,"Acquisitions Bolster Symantec Vs. Cisco, Palo Alto: Analyst","Symantec[ticker symb=SYMC] is making the right moves with acquisitions, says Morgan Stanley, which upped its price target on the computer security software provider Wednesday.

Analyst Keith Weiss upped his price target to 37 from 33 a share, noting that recent acquisitions should help improve its standing amid rivals such as Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW).","""(With acquisitions) Blue Coat and LifeLock, we see Symantec posting high single-digit revenue growth in fiscal 2018/19 on an organic basis and 36% operating margins in 2019 — a material improvement from Symantec's flat growth profile and 28% operating margins in December 2015,"" Weiss said in a note to clients.

Mountain View, Calif.-based Symantec acquired Blue Coat Systems in 2016 for $4.65 billion. Blue Coat Chief Executive Greg Clark became Symantec's CEO in August. Then in February, Symantec closed the purchase of LifeLock, a provider of consumer identity-theft protection services, for $2.3 billion.

""With the LifeLock and BlueCoat acquisitions, we see Symantec returning its consumer business to growth while better addressing long-term secular themes within enterprise security, such as consolidation into security platforms and increased visibility across multiple attack vectors,"" added Weiss.

Symantec on Feb. 1 reported fiscal third-quarter earnings and revenue that topped views but forecast current-quarter sales and profit below expectations.

IBD'S TAKE: Revenue growth is harder to come by for many security vendors these days as large companies reassess spending priorities. Chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which tops the IBD 50 roster of growth stocks, reported revenue growth of 38% to $6.9 billion in 2016.

The LifeLock deal is aimed at bolstering its Norton security unit. The Blue Coat acquisition put Symantec in the fast-growing cloud-access security broker market. CASB products act as a middleman between a corporate network and cloud applications hosted externally.

Symantec recently announced a $1 billion debt offering. It could make more acquisitions, says Weiss.

""We believe Symantec will focus its investments on the enterprise side of its business, adding technology that bolsters its security focused on the cloud, and endpoint detection/remediation capabilities,"" he wrote.

Symantec stock rose 2.2% to 30.66 on the stock market today. Shares in Symantec have climbed 28% in 2017.

(Nasdaq: CERN) would work with outside providers before signing a final contract, Secretary David Shulkin told Politico.","Shulkin announced in June that the VA would pick Cerner to update its aging EHR system to allow for easy back-and-forth communication of records with the Department of Defense. The North Kansas City-based health care IT company has deployed the MHS Genesis system at four DoD pilot sites, and has begun working on deploying the system to the entire DoD network by 2022.

The VA previously indicated that it expected to have a contract with Cerner last month. But other hurdles have stood in the way, including Congress moving over enough funds for the project to start. Shulkin requested $782 million for 2018, but the full cost of the 10-year contract has been estimated at $10 billion.

Shulkin's question is not around how well Cerner's system would work with entities within the VA's network, but whether it would be fully interoperable with private-sector providers offered through the VA's Choice Program.

Politico reported that the VA issued a request for information (RFI) for data-sharing solutions, and also may run ""case studies"" to see if the VA receives meaningful information after patients are sent through the system.

Shulkin announced in June that the VA would pick Cerner to update its aging EHR system to allow for easy back-and-forth communication of records with the Department of Defense. The North Kansas City-based health care IT company has deployed the MHS Genesis system at four DoD pilot sites, and has begun working on deploying the system to the entire DoD network by 2022.

The VA previously indicated that it expected to have a contract with Cerner last month. But other hurdles have stood in the way, including Congress moving over enough funds for the project to start. Shulkin requested $782 million for 2018, but the full cost of the 10-year contract has been estimated at $10 billion.

Shulkin's question is not around how well Cerner's system would work with entities within the VA's network, but whether it would be fully interoperable with private-sector providers offered through the VA's Choice Program.

Politico reported that the VA issued a request for information (RFI) for data-sharing solutions, and also may run ""case studies"" to see if the VA receives meaningful information after patients are sent through the system.

119,NYTF000020130719e97j0009a,Microsoft Shares Drop After It Disappoints on Profit and Sales,"SEATTLE -- The personal computer business has been in the worst downturn since the industry's inception, but Microsoft has shown a knack for finding ways to insulate itself. Until now.

On Thursday, the company missed Wall Street forecasts, blaming the declining PC market for the shortfall. Microsoft also acknowledged the disappointing sales of one of its most prominent products, its Surface RT tablet computer, by taking a $900 million charge to reflect unsold inventory of the device.","''It finally caught up to them,'' said Colin W. Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners. ''We've been in a PC recession for five quarters.''

For the fiscal fourth quarter that ended June 30, Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Wash., reported net income of $4.97 billion, or 59 cents a share, in contrast to a loss of $492 million, or 6 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Last year, Microsoft took a $6 billion write-down on a soured acquisition, wiping out its overall profit.

In the latest quarter, revenue rose 10 percent, to $19.9 billion, from $18.06 billion a year earlier.

Those results fell well short of the average analyst estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters of 75 cents a share in earnings and $20.73 billion in revenue.

Revenue from Microsoft's Windows business, which includes its Surface tablet computers, rose 6 percent, to $4.41 billion. But without including the favorable impact from an upgrade offer last year, Microsoft's Windows revenue fell 6 percent in the quarter.

Last week, the research firm Gartner reported that global PC shipments declined 10.9 percent in the second quarter of the year, the fifth consecutive quarter of declining PC shipments, the longest ever.

Mobile devices have sapped much of the gusto out of the PC market. Many people are buying tablet computers, especially Apple's iPad, instead of PCs to watch movies, surf the Web and write e-mails.

''We know we have to do better, particularly on mobile devices,'' Amy Hood, Microsoft's chief financial officer, said in an interview.

Ms. Hood said the company's Windows business is a ''tale of two markets,'' one in which PC sales to businesses continue to grow modestly, while consumer demand for the machines is fizzling. She estimated that total industry PC shipments to the consumer market fell more than 20 percent during the quarter.

She said that a companywide reorganization that Microsoft announced last week was part of an effort to better position the business for big changes in technology, including the shift to mobile devices.

Until its most recent quarter, Microsoft showed a remarkable aptitude for finding ways to squeeze money out of its venerable business, despite the problems in the PC market. It did that through lucrative multiyear software contracts with corporate customers that tend to move far more slowly than consumers in adopting newer technologies.

Parts of Microsoft that cater more to businesses helped lessen the sting. Microsoft said revenue in its server and tools group rose 9 percent, to $5.5 billion. Revenue in its business division, dominated by the Office suite of applications, jumped 14 percent, to $7.21 billion. But the division grew only 2 percent without deferred revenue related to an earlier upgrade offer.

Office is under siege from a suite of online applications from Google and others, which has led Microsoft to adapt the software so it can be delivered as a service through cloud computing. Microsoft said that if Office 365, the version of its productivity applications that are offered as a service, were to perform for a full year at current levels, it would generate $1.5 billion in revenue.

''The consumer has voted,'' said Barbara Coffey, an analyst at S&P Capital IQ. ''I don't know that enterprise has yet. We've seen such a big shift to tablets. Microsoft just doesn't play in tablets at the same level that they do in PCs.''

Investors had become more bullish on Microsoft's ability to navigate the disruption of the PC market, sending its shares up more than 32 percent this year. But after the release of its financial results, shares of Microsoft dropped more than 6 percent in after-hours trading. They ended regular trading at $35.44, down 30 cents.","Microsoft Shares Drop After It Disappoints on Profit and Sales SEATTLE -- The personal computer business has been in the worst downturn since the industry's inception, but Microsoft has shown a knack for finding ways to insulate itself.

260,DJDN000020141023eaan003ls,Press Release: Federal Contractor Achieves Companywide Benefits by Leveraging Ultimate Software's Cloud-Based UltiPro for Unified Human Capital Management,"Federal Contractor Achieves Companywide Benefits by Leveraging Ultimate Software's Cloud-Based UltiPro for Unified Human Capital Management 


WESTON, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 23, 2014-- ","Ultimate Software (Nasdaq: ULTI), a leading cloud provider of people management solutions, announced today that the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), a nonprofit association of universities and institutions that operates astronomical observatories and telescopes, is leveraging the UltiPro solution to optimize processes for human capital management (HCM), provide strategic business intelligence to managers and executives, and deliver measurable benefits to employees and the overall organization.

AURA is a consortium of 39 U.S.-based institutions and six international affiliates focused on establishing and promoting public observatories and facilities that advance innovative astronomical research. In addition, the nonprofit organization is committed to public and educational outreach throughout the astronomical community and the general public.

Previously, AURA had been using multiple systems, including an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, to handle its processes for HR, payroll, and talent management. The company's HR teams spent significant time and resources on duplicate data entry, manual reconciliation, and administration, and company leaders found challenges with upgrades, flexibility, and integration. In 2007, AURA made the switch to cloud-based UltiPro because it offered a single-source, flexible solution with instant, 24-7 access for employees across the U.S.

""Having UltiPro and cloud-based technology has made a huge difference in enhancing our processes for HR, payroll, and talent management,"" said Lee Peters, HRIS administrator at the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy. ""Plus, as a nonprofit government contractor, we have to dedicate our full focus on our missions and keep administrative costs in control. With UltiPro, our internal IT resources are free from having to manage or maintain multiple systems, and these resources are now being applied to supporting the defining aspects of our organization.""

UltiPro is providing AURA with a unified suite of HCM, including HR, payroll, benefits enrollment, recruitment, performance management, and more. Employees in any location have immediate access to individual information and strategic tools to perform business activities. UltiPro delivers one system of record for workforce information, and data is available for instant reporting across its people management processes. With quick access to in-depth business intelligence, executives and managers can make informed day-to-day and long-term strategic decisions about their employees and related business issues.

""Since we switched to UltiPro, the ability to have on-demand reports has been a huge advantage. With our previous systems, writing a report was a very complex process. Now we can get information in seconds. A big win for us is that we can automate reports that are delivered to individuals or teams on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis,"" said Peters. ""For example, we have automated reports that go to division management to closely monitor staff overtime. We also have reports that are sent to multiple teams so they can evaluate open staffing requisitions, when these were initiated, the time to fill a job, as well other valuable analytics.""

""Even though we have multiple locations across the U.S., we operate under one FEIN, and we have to aggregate multiple EE0-1and Veterans reports. Previously, each of the centers had to independently run these numbers, and then our teams had to manually add the numbers up to complete the filings. With UltiPro, we can pull specific data for each of our locations and have it automatically aggregated for the consolidated filing of the EE0-1. When any of our executives, managers, or employees asks for information, I'll say that if it's in the solution, we can deliver what you want, however you want to see it. What we really like with UltiPro is that pretty much every single field that you can see is reportable.""

With UltiPro, AURA is creating smooth, efficient, open processes for its HCM, and as a result, the nonprofit has achieved substantial time and cost savings. For example, UltiPro Open Enrollment significantly reduces the time and expense associated with administering employee benefits. By providing employees with an easy-to-use web experience, UltiPro minimizes paperwork for HR and benefits professionals, eliminates the need to print and distribute forms, and enables employees to review benefits options and make elections from anywhere via the UltiPro portal. Plus, employee benefits elections and ensuing deductions are processed in one system -- no reconciliations are necessary.

""I can't even begin to say how much time UltiPro has saved us with benefits enrollment. Previously, we had a payroll system, HR system, and benefits system, and we had to cross-check all three to make sure data was correct. With UltiPro, information is transmitted in seconds. We have eliminated two weeks of manual entry for open enrollment because it is now completely integrated with payroll,"" said Peters. ""The overall result is tremendous time savings. By eliminating multiple systems, we now have the freedom and resources to support additional initiatives -- projects that we just would not have had time for if we were still entrenched in the day-to-day, manual labor of maintaining multiple systems.""

""Relying on multiple systems for HR, payroll, and talent management is not only inefficient, but a substantial drain on a company's internal resources. With a unified HCM solution, AURA is experiencing a full range of business benefits, including speed, accuracy, time- and cost-savings, cohesive business intelligence, and more,"" said Greg Swick, chief sales officer at Ultimate Software. ""We're very pleased that UltiPro is providing this unique organization and its teams with measurable business outcomes.""

286,COMWKN0020150917eb9h000cn,Mentor Graphics Corporation; Mentor Graphics Announces New Version of Open ODB++ Intelligent Product Model for PCB Manufacturing,"2015 SEP 23 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Computer Weekly News -- Mentor Graphics Corporation (NASDAQ: MENT) announced its newest version of the industry-leading ODB++ intelligent product model, a single and open data structure for transferring printed circuit board (PCB) designs into data for fabrication, assembly and test. The version 8.1 of the ODB++ product model format provides a unique virtual documentation capability that seamlessly translates all data files, drawings, and documents from PCB design through the manufacturing flow.

http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20140317/AQ83812LOGO","This open product model format eliminates the need to create and validate disparate documentation content, supporting all electronic design automation (EDA) tool flows. Users of the new ODB++ version will be able to share all the necessary manufacturing instructions as electronic data, making new product introduction (NPI) more efficient for all partners in the supply chain.

The idea behind virtual documentation content is to replace a disparate set of drawings, documents and instructions with data elements that allow the recipient tool to automate the planning and execution of the manufacturing process preparation actions. An example would be to define the solder mask finish color within the ODB++ product model so that a PCB fabricator can automatically generate the process, material and routing instructions for that individual factory.

The ODB++ product model also includes support for EDA-based design net connectivity shorts. In many designs, one or more nets are intentionally shorted into a single net; the ODB++ product model now carries that net attribute so that all downstream processes can be streamlined and automated. The lack of such net characterization has been a limitation of existing data formats, resulting in wasted efforts between design and manufacturing.

Additionally, content for rigid-flex buildup zones to define regions within the basic stack-up (either unique or within the same region) on the board can be carried forward into analysis and in the actual material-based stack-up definition. This feature delivers accurate impedance calculations, using tools such as the Frontline InStack for this capability. By accurately identifying the physical boundary of different stack-up areas for a rigid-flex circuit, the correct DFM rules can be applied automatically, and rigid-flex circuit manufacturers can easily and accurately calculate the impedance values for the circuit using their choice of materials.

Supporting All Intelligent Product Model Formats Mentor Graphics and the Valor Division have a proven legacy regarding the lean NPI hand-off from design to manufacturing, including stewardship of the ODB++ product model. A new format known as the IPC-2581 standard has emerged for organizing and conveying PCB designs from CAD tools to CAM systems for fabrication and assembly. Mentor is extending its support to the IPC-2581 Consortium and accompanying format standardization efforts.

""Mentor is the market leader for PCB design software and provides a best-in-class solution for NPI. With our latest ODB++ intelligent product model format, we now offer customers a complete and open design-through-manufacturing ecosystem,"" stated A.J. Incorvaia, vice president and general manager of Mentor Graphics Systems Design Division. ""Our mission is to provide our customers with the best tools and technologies to increase overall product quality and productivity. This includes support for ODB++ and IPC-2581, giving our customers a choice in data exchange formats for hand-off to manufacturing.""

""I am very pleased that Mentor Graphics has chosen to participate in the IPC-2581 consortium. Both Mentor's successful ODB++ experiences and the successes of the IPC-2581 consortium make a winning combination in our country's efforts to optimize the design-to-manufacturing ecosystem. I look forward to witnessing the progress of this exciting and challenging effort,"" said Gary Ferrari, technical support director, FTG Circuits.

Most Widely Adopted Data Format Worldwide With over 18,000 global members and over 60 partners to implement and develop the ODB++ product model format as the de facto standard, it is supported by all computer aided manufacturing (CAM) systems sold over the past ten years. A lean NPI process encompasses DFM-validated (clean) product model transfer between tools in the design-to-manufacturing ecosystem - it's not just about a data format. Around 80% of all boards used in the world are Valor(R) ODB++ compliant because of alignment within the ecosystem. The ODB++ Solutions Alliance was developed for the PCB manufacturing implementers and supporters, offering free software tools, specifications, documentation, and forums for users.

Last Thursday, founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the launch of Internet.org, a partnership with mobile device maker Samsung and others to bring Web access to the two-thirds of the world's population without it.

Facebook stock, up 50% since July 24, fell 4.1% in the stock marketTuesday as equities sold off worldwide on fears of U.S. military action in Syria. Facebook hit a closing high Monday.

In the business arena, LinkedIn is the top social network, linking professionals with each other and with companies searching for employees. The company last week unveiled its new University Pages, and opened its network to college-minded high school students. It lowered the minimum age limit for U.S. users to 14 from 18, and to 13 in most other countries starting Sept. 12. Shares slid 2.7% Tuesday after hitting a record high Monday.

China's Qihoo 360 jumped 8% on Monday after its second-quarter profit and revenue more than doubled from a year ago, smashing analyst estimates. Qihoo's investments in online search technology to take on Chinese search leader Baidu (BIDU) are paying off, analysts said, as Qihoo approaches a 20% market share. Qihoo edged a little higher on Tuesday to fresh records, but shares fell 4% late after the company announced a plan to sell $550 million in convertible debt.

Michael Kors seems never to go out of style. Consumers like the company's trendy luxury apparel and accessories. Amid strong, growing global sales, its stock price has risen 256% from its $20 initial offering on Dec. 16, 2011, to a close of 71.23 Tuesday, down nearly 2% for the day.

Like peers Priceline.com (PCLN) and former parent Expedia (EXPE), TripAdvisor is benefiting from renewed consumer and business travel as the world gradually recovers from the Great Recession. It's taken a bit of a ride lately though as shares climbed 34% in three weeks from July 24 to Aug. 12, then fell 9% on Aug. 14 after CEO Steve Kaufer cautioned at an investment conference that summer travel trends have been weaker than expected.

TripAdvisor fell 1.6% Tuesday.

384,HNASNI0020191123efbo00566,Amazon files lawsuit challenging Pentagon's decision to award cloud contract to Microsoft,"Washington DC, Nov. 24 -- : Amazon has filed a lawsuit challenging US Defence Department's decision to award a USD 10 billion cloud computing contract to rival Microsoft last month.

A spokesperson for Amazon Web Services confirmed the Hill on Friday that the suit was filed in the US Court of Federal Claims under seal. The company did not explain the basis of its complaint.","The suit contains ""proprietary information, trade secrets, and confidential financial information"" that could ""cause either party severe competitive harm,"" Amazon said in a court document.

The company, which had been considered a front-runner to win the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) cloud computing contract, had earlier claimed that the deal was marred by ""errors and unmistakeable bias"".

The 10-year contract, which is intended to transform and modernise the US military's cloud computing system, is considered significant, owing to its centrality to ""new forms of war"". Presently, much of the US military operates on computer systems from the 1980s and 1990s.

The Pentagon chose Microsoft's Azure cloud for the job, saying that the company would help improve the ""speed and effectiveness with which we develop and deploy modernised technical capabilities to our men and women in uniform.""

The decision had come as a surprise to Amazon, given that the company was considered a front-runner to win the contract, while Microsoft was considered in the lead for other government cloud programmes, including an intelligence contract.

Recently, a book written by the speechwriter for former Defence Secretary James Mattis has claimed that Trump had directed Mattis to ""screw Amazon"" out of Pentagon's USD 10 billion cloud computing contract.

Trump in the past has voiced his displeasure with Amazon and Jeff Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post. He has accused Amazon of taking advantage of the Postal Service even as independent investigations have disagreed with it.

268,HOU0000020140813ea8c00017,5 myths about Facebook Messenger app,"NEW YORK - Facebook's recent effort to force people to adopt its standalone mobile messaging app has privacy-concerned users up in arms. Many of them believe the app is especially invasive.

One blog from the Huffington Post published in December has gone viral, making the rounds on the social network recently because it claims the app gives Facebook ""direct control over your mobile device"" and allows Facebook to call phone numbers without a users' intervention and send text messages without confirmation, but none of that is accurate.","In truth, Facebook Messenger isn't any more invasive than Facebook's main app - or other similar applications.

The fear and confusion stem from a message that greets owners of Android devices when they install the app. It explains that the app requires permission access to the device's camera, microphone, list of contacts and other information.

Here's what Facebook's mobile messaging app does and doesn't do.

Myth: You have to use the Messenger app if you want to send messages to your Facebook friends.

Reality: While it's required to download if you are using Facebook's mobile app on the iPhone or Android smartphones, you can avoid it if you use the Facebook messenger service on your desktop or laptop, iPad or even the mobile Facebook website.

Myth: The Messenger app's terms of service are different from - and more intrusive than - Facebook's own official terms.

Reality: Facebook's terms of service are the same for all its mobile apps., including the main Facebook app. What's upsetting people is the list of ""permissions"" they see when they download and install the app on an Android phone. It's a long list with 10 items, each of which states that the app needs access to features on your phone including contacts, calendar, location data and Wi-Fi information. Sure, that's a lot of personal data. But it's the same data most messaging apps have access to. On the iPhone, users don't get the list of permissions when they install the app, but when they use it, permissions pop up individually.

Myth: The Messenger app will use your phone's microphone to record you.

Reality: The app needs permission to use your phone's microphone and camera. But it requires that access because the microphone is needed for voice calling, a service that the standalone app offers that the Facebook app doesn't, and sending sound with videos. Same with the camera - it needs access if you want to send your friends pictures.

Myth: Facebook will direct the app to send SMS, or text, messages without your permission.

Reality: One of the permissions does say that Facebook can edit, receive, read and send SMS messages. But the company says the reason it wants to send and receive SMS messages is so that if you add a phone number to your Messenger account, you can confirm by a code that Facebook sends via text message.

Myth: The Messenger app is new.

Reality: Facebook's Messenger app has been around since 2011. In April, it started requiring that users in Europe install the app if they wish to send messages to Facebook friends. Two weeks ago, the company said it would expand the requirement to other parts of the world. Facebook says it's forcing users to make the switch because a standalone app offers more features.

Allies join clash against warrants

NEW YORK - Facebook's fight against prosecutors over nearly 400 search warrants for users' postings and other data is drawing support from other social media companies and civil libertarians.

Lawyers for Foursquare, Kickstarter, Meetup, and Tumblr said Monday they were seeking to join the clash on Facebook's side. The New York Civil Liberties Union and the American Civil Liberties Union also have recently said they were backing Facebook.

They see the warrants - for data including friend lists, photos, and private messages, many of them from users who have yet to be charged and may never be - as a troubling message for digital-age privacy.

29,JOENG00020131129e9c4002pe,Vonage Network LLC; Patent Issued for Method and Apparatus for Providing an Identifier for a Caller ID Function in a Telecommunication System,"2013 DEC 4 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Journal of Engineering -- According to news reporting originating from Alexandria, Virginia, by VerticalNews journalists, a patent by the inventors Ma, Kevin Ka-yui (North Brunswick, NJ); Wilton, Art (East Windsor, NJ); Villani, Pasquale (Freehold, NJ); Smires, Daniel (Freehold, NJ); South, Michael (Jackson, NJ); Guo, Zhiyu (East Brunswick, NJ), filed on November 4, 2011, was published online on November 19, 2013.

The assignee for this patent, patent number 8588387, is Vonage Network LLC (Holmdel, NJ).","Reporters obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: ""The present invention relates generally to telecommunication systems and, more particularly, to a method and system for virtual number direct access dialing in a telecommunication system.

""Voice over IP (VoIP) is a technological development in the field of telecommunications that is utilized to transmit voice conversations over a data network using the Internet Protocol (IP). After a user subscribes to a VoIP service, the user can make phone calls to other VoIP subscribers or to public switched telephone network (PSTN) customers and access a number of features associated with the VoIP service, such as call waiting, three-way calling, call forwarding, voicemail service, and the like.

""Telecommunication systems, including VoIP systems, typically distinguish between local telephone calls and long distance telephone calls. A long distance telephone call is one made outside of a defined area, such as outside a particular U.S. area code. In terms of dialing, local phone numbers are shorter than long distance phone numbers. For example, according to the North American Numbering Plan (NANP), a long distance telephone number includes a one-digit country calling code, a three-digit area code, a three-digit exchange code, and a four-digit number for a total of 11 digits. A local telephone number may include just the three-digit exchange code and the four-digit number for a total of 7 digits. An international long distance telephone number includes more than 11 digits, including an international access code (e.g., 011), a country code, and up to 13 additional digits. Dialing these many digits can be cumbersome and some contact or phone book applications associated with a user device may be ill-suited to accept international phone numbers.

""Typically, the same service provider will serve all outgoing telephone calls, both local and long distance. Hence, a subscriber of a telephone service has little choice for long distance service other than that provided by the service provider. Further, a subscriber to a telephone service is assigned a particular telephone number. To call the subscriber, the calling party dials the assigned telephone number. If the subscriber decides to switch service providers and cannot port the previously assigned telephone number, the subscriber must update all interested parties with a new telephone number.

""Generally, when a subscriber makes an outbound call, the subscriber cannot provide desired caller ID information as he has extremely limited control over same. For example, the subscriber may choose to either block or unblock whatever caller ID information may be available (by virtue of files maintained by the service provider or third party) and cannot select what caller ID information would be preferred based on the called party. This is particularly undesirable when placing international calls where one or both parties could be charged excessive communication fees based on long distance carrier rates, roaming charges and the like. Similarly, if the called party desires to call back the user, this operation would most likely be carried out based on the telephone number provided in the caller ID information. Such caller ID information would inconveniently result in a long distance call on the return path.

""Accordingly, there exists a need in the art for a method and system for providing improved caller ID information in a telecommunication system that overcomes the disadvantages associated with incoming and outgoing long distance calls.""

In addition to obtaining background information on this patent, VerticalNews editors also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: ""Method, system, and computer readable medium for providing an identifier for a caller identifier (ID) function when processing a communication request between a calling party and a called party in a communication network is described. In some embodiments, an initial identifier for the caller ID function associated with the calling party is received. A determination is made if the calling party has a virtual identifier configured in the communication network. A determination is made if the called party has a predefined identifier associated with the calling party configured in the communication network. The initial identifier is replaced with a terminating identifier based on configuration of the virtual identifier and the predefined identifier in the communication network.""

Further, a subscriber to a telephone service is assigned a particular telephone number. To call the subscriber, the calling party dials the assigned telephone number. If the subscriber decides to switch service providers and cannot port the previously assigned telephone number, the subscriber must update all interested parties with a new telephone number.

""Generally, when a subscriber makes an outbound call, the subscriber cannot provide desired caller ID information as he has extremely limited control over same. For example, the subscriber may choose to either block or unblock whatever caller ID information may be available (by virtue of files maintained by the service provider or third party) and cannot select what caller ID information would be preferred based on the called party. This is particularly undesirable when placing international calls where one or both parties could be charged excessive communication fees based on long distance carrier rates, roaming charges and the like. Similarly, if the called party desires to call back the user, this operation would most likely be carried out based on the telephone number provided in the caller ID information. Such caller ID information would inconveniently result in a long distance call on the return path.

""Accordingly, there exists a need in the art for a method and system for providing improved caller ID information in a telecommunication system that overcomes the disadvantages associated with incoming and outgoing long distance calls.""

In addition to obtaining background information on this patent, VerticalNews editors also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: ""Method, system, and computer readable medium for providing an identifier for a caller identifier (ID) function when processing a communication request between a calling party and a called party in a communication network is described. In some embodiments, an initial identifier for the caller ID function associated with the calling party is received. A determination is made if the calling party has a virtual identifier configured in the communication network. A determination is made if the called party has a predefined identifier associated with the calling party configured in the communication network. The initial identifier is replaced with a terminating identifier based on configuration of the virtual identifier and the predefined identifier in the communication network.""

India's largest IT services firm Tata Consultancy Services ( TCS) is folding up its Lucknow centre and has asked over 1,000 employees to shift to some other unit of the company in the country.","The development comes in the wake of concern over reports of mass layoffs across top companies in the sector, including TCS, Infosys, Wipro, HCL Technologies and Tech Mahindra. Though these companies have been trying to allay fears over job losses, they are under pressure to cut costs amid automation and increased protectionism in developed countries, including the US — the biggest market for India’s $ 150 billion IT export sector.

On Wednesday, TCs employees at the Lucknow centre were told about the closure, and reportedly asked to accept transfers or look for jobs elsewhere. The company will shift most of its projects to Noida by this December.

However, the TCS claimed, “ Rumours and reports are being circulated in the media about the company’s operations in Lucknow. TCS would like to clarify that it is only consolidating its UP operations in Noida and there will be no job loss as a consequence.

Employees have sent a petition to UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi to intervene in the issue. Around 2,000 employees, half of them women, would be affected by this shift, a group called ‘ SaveTCSPlease’ has said in the letter.

The letter said that around 300- 400 employees will be retained in the Lucknow premises and that most of the existing projects will be transferred to the upcoming centre in Indore. They alleged that employees are being forced to transfer to other cities. The letter was signed by "" TCS Lucknow employees and their dependents"". Meanwhile, UP labour minister Swami Prasad Maurya negotiations would be held to protect the interest of at least 2,000 employees, if necessary.

Staff being offered shift to Noida and Indore

Minister Mohsin Raza said he was ready to speak to the TCS management and the employees to find a way out, if needed.

It is said that some of these employees could be taken in at the new centre coming up TCS was one of the companies singled out by the Donald Trump administration in the US as unfairly cornering the lion’s share of H- 1B visas by putting extra tickets in the lottery system. The Trump administration wants to replace with a more meritbased immigration policy.

Infosys and Cognizant were the other two companies.

US President Donald Trump had also asked federal agencies to review the H- 1B visa program that Indian IT firms use to fly engineers to the US to service clients. After the move, India's third- largest software services exporter Wipro said more than half its workforce in the US consists of locals after it hired more than 1,600 people in the last six months. Infosys also said it planned to hire 10,000 US workers in the next two years.

Q1 NETPROFITFALLS 5.9% TCS on Thursday posted a 5.9 per cent decline in its net profit for the April- June quarter at Rs 5,945 crore, hit by the rupee’s volatility.

The software major posted a net profit of Rs 6,317 crore in the corresponding threemonth period of 2016- 17.

TCS could post only a marginal increase of 1 per cent in its consolidated revenue at Rs 29,584 crore during the quarter as against Rs 29,305 crore in the year- ago period.

When compared to the January- March 2017 quarter, its net profit during the period under review fell 10 per cent, while revenue slipped 0.2 per cent. TCS chief financial officer V Ramakrishnan said during the quarter, high currency volatility, including sharp rupee appreciation against the dollar, resulted in Rs 650 crore loss in reported revenues.

TCS CEO and MD Rajesh Gopinathan said the company has seen steady growth across industries in the first quarter of the fiscal. “ That positions us well for growth in financial year 2017- 18,” he added.","TCS winds up Lucknow ops 1,000 techies face uncertain future

Which Formula 1 car is best on high-speed corners, which on straights? Which player should a team buy?AI and machine learning (ML) are being used in fascinating ways in sports to help players and sports administrators take better decisions, and to enable broadcasters to offer new and real-time data that enriches the fan experience.

In Amazon Web Services (AWS), it's Priya Ponnapalli's job to enable these solutions. Priya grew up in Hyderabad, did her engineering there, and then went to the University of Texas in Austin for a Master's and PhD in electrical and computer engineering. She is today principal scientist and senior manager on the Amazon machine learning solutions team.","The question, she says, is no longer whether a company should have a ML strategy, but rather how they can quickly and effectively get their ML strategy into motion.""We have been working with some of the largest sports organisations in the world - Formula 1, the US National Football League (NFL), Nascar, Bundesliga and many more. We start with the business problems and work backwards from there to solve it using innovations,"" she says.

NFL has built ML models using Amazon's flagship ML service, Sage-Maker, and its own vast troves of data - images, videos, data from RFID tags on players' shoulder pads and on the football. Today, those models enable NFL to track complex data on the field, such as the precise X-Y coordinates of a player, speed and movement patterns. Priya says this data helps NFL officiate the game better. ""They are also sent to the broadcast booths for additional insights, and are used to enhance the fan experience,"" she says.

NFL team Seattle Seahawks uses the system to collect ongoing information about players, like their exertion level, their explosive movements, how often they work out, and more. This helps, Priya says, to generate new insights into player injuries, game rules, equipment, rehabilitation and recovery.

In F1, each car has some 120 sensors on them generating over 3GB of data each second. F1 uses Sage-Maker to train deep learning models with 65 years of historical race data. And then they use the system to make race predictions, track critical race performance statistics, and give fans insights into split second decisions and strategies adopted by teams and drivers.

Each team builds a car with what they see as the ideal mix of grip, downforce, drag and power. And so each car has its own strengths and weaknesses. On F1's TV coverage, the ML system creates car performance scores graphics based on the numerous data points it captures - how each car performs in different kinds of corners, on straights, how much it understeers, oversteers.

For the German football league Bundesliga, models have been created that can precisely determine what is the goal probability of different kinds of shots. The ML algorithm has been trained on shots on goal, looking at distance and angles of goals, position of opposition defenders, goalkeeper's position, the speed of the player at the moment he shoots. So, a split second before a goal, the model can tell fans the probability of a goal.""As we get more data, models improve,"" says Priya.","How AWS's Priya Ponnapalli is using AI in Formula 1, NFL THE GURUWhat's the probability of a shot going into goal?

""As already discussed above, in a typical pen tablet, generation of a pen drawing image (referred to in the following as pen drawing processing) is performed by a CPU. However, the CPU performs pen drawing processing at relatively low processing speed, due to the CPU performing various types of other software processing in the meantime in order to control the entire pen tablet.

""Accordingly, a user of a typical pen tablet is given an impression that processing speed of the pen tablet is low, due to a relatively great amount of time being required until a pen drawing image is actually displayed from when the user performs pen input by using a stylus pen. In particular, a CPU in a portable pen tablet such as a smartphone or a tablet terminal has relatively low processing ability. Further, in such a portable pen tablet, while a drawing application is being executed, many other applications may be executed in the meantime. In such a case, the slowness of pen drawing processing by the CPU becomes even more prominent. This results in users being provided with an uncomfortable writing/drawing experience.

""Means for Solving the Technical Problems

""In view of the technical problems described above, the present invention aims to provide information input/display devices and information input/display methods that reduce the amount of time from input to display and thereby provide users a realistic writing/drawing experience.

41,LKLNDL0020140602ea610000a,Amazon Takes On Giants of Gaming World,"LAKE FOREST, Calif. | At a studio tucked away in a nondescript Orange County office park, Amazon.com is hoping to remake the video game business.

Over the past year, two dozen or so developers at Amazon Game Studios raced to create ""Sev Zero,"" a video game that's not so much a blockbuster as it is a window into Amazon's gaming ambition.","""Sev Zero"" doesn't have mind-melting graphics or a riveting storyline that keeps gamers itching for the next battle.

Instead, it's a somewhat familiar game, in which gamers battle aliens to protect Earth's power grid.

The weapons include shotguns and rifles, and players can unlock upgrades as they progress through the game. The menacing aliens are never too clever.

""Sev Zero"" is a fine diversion but not likely to displace ""Halo,"" ""Call of Duty"" or the current favorite, ""Titanfall,"" in hard-core gamers' hearts.

But it would be wrong to write off Amazon's game business as merely another feature it packed into its new Fire TV streaming-media device, launched last month.

That would underestimate Amazon's ambition and misread the potential threat to as much as $1 billion of the company's annual revenue.

The online retail giant has been beefing up its game-development staff and acquiring game studios as one risk looms: It needs a strategy to replace its sales of shiny $60 video game disks when the vast majority of those games are eventually downloaded or streamed.

To understand Amazon's strategy, it's important to consider digital-media history. Amazon was late to the digital-music transformation a decade ago, when Apple's iPod and iTunes shifted music sales from physical compact discs to digital downloads. CD sales plummeted and many millions of dollars in revenue evaporated from Amazon, among the largest purveyors of those disks. It eventually developed its own digital-music business, but it's been playing catchup ever since.

There's little doubt that the lion's share of video games, even the graphics-laden blockbusters that sell for $60 a disk, will one day be available via download or stream. Current limitations in bandwidth mean that day is still years away. But just as surely as music, books and movies can be delivered digitally, so eventually will games.

""That's become a matter of truth,"" said Mike Frazzini, the vice president who runs Amazon's game business, noting that there already are plenty of popular PC games, such as ""League of Legends"" and ""World of Tanks,"" that are downloadable.

And for Amazon, that truth comes with some potential risks. Amazon generates about $1 billion in annual sales of physical video games from its website, said Robert W. Baird & Co. analyst Colin Sebastian. It's among the top video game retailers, trailing only GameStop, Walmart and a handful of big-box stores. As the game market evolves to digital delivery, Amazon needs to put itself in a position to retain game sales that would otherwise disappear.

""It's absolutely critical that they stay relevant when it comes to digital distribution,"" Sebastian said. ""For Amazon, they obviously need to be there.""

While Amazon has little history in gaming, it brings plenty of other assets to the business. It clearly knows how to sell content digitally, having done so with the Amazon Appstore for Android devices. Its Amazon Web Services, which rents infrastructure computer services to other companies over the Internet, could one day render complex graphics on its servers and stream games online.

Amazon's first serious step into game development came in 2008, when it bought Reflexive Entertainment, a Lake Forest, Calif., studio that made casual games for PCs and the Xbox 360.

In March 2013, the game studio got word that Amazon was going to launch a TV set-top box in a year, and the company wanted a marquee game that could debut at the same time. The task, though, wasn't to just build a fun game. Developers at the studio had to create a title that could showcase the capabilities of Amazon's new streaming-media device.

A small team of four developers and designers cobbled together a prototype that would become ""Sev Zero."" To move quickly, they reused assets created from other games. In the earliest prototype, the hero was a stock ninja character and the baddies, evil aliens in the final version, were ogres. Within three weeks they created a simple maze where the ninjas could teleport in and battle the ogres.

Initially, the game included a split screen when two gamers played, a feature common to multiplayer games. But a few months into the development, Ernie Ramirez, who runs the Lake Forest studio, decided to cut the split screen for something that he thought could be much better.

Ramirez's team had figured out a way for gamers with Kindle Fire tablets to connect with other players, essentially targeting and blasting aliens to give air support to the primary gamer using a controller. The developers felt the new approach didn't just make the game more fun; it also showcased the Fire TV's ability to connect with a mobile device to enhance a game.

A month after the game's launch, it's gotten mixed reviews. Though only 16 customers have rated the game on Amazon's website, they've given it 4.4 stars out of 5. But reviews from other video-game websites haven't been as kind.

""While the action portion is entertaining, it simply doesn't have much personality,"" said a review in Shacknews, which follows the video-game business. ""The story isn't particularly engaging as well. What we end up with is a game that's fun for a while, but very easy to put down.""","Amazon Takes On Giants of Gaming World LAKE FOREST, Calif. | At a studio tucked away in a nondescript Orange County office park, Amazon.com is hoping to remake the video game business.

47,ACWIRE0020200804eg84001p5,Cyren's New Anti-Phishing Product Quickly Gains Market Traction,"Cyren Inbox Security protects Microsoft 365 users from phishing and BEC attacks

McLEAN, VA / ACCESSWIRE / August 4, 2020 / Cyren (NASDAQ:CYRN), a provider of email security and threat intelligence solutions, disclosed today that its recently released Cyren Inbox Security product has achieved positive initial market traction with enterprise customers who have adopted the new cloud-based service to protect their organizations from the ongoing threat of phishing attacks targeted at Microsoft 365 (formerly Office 365) users.","Image: https://www.accesswire.com/users/newswire/images/600128/image.png

Cyren Inbox Security was released in the second quarter of 2020 and is providing value to initial customers across a variety of industry verticals by detecting and remediating thousands of phishing incidents on a weekly basis. The common thread across all customers is the increasing rate of phishing emails that successfully penetrate traditional email security defenses, which typically are secure email gateways.

""There are other types of attacks we have to deal with, but phishing is completely out of control. We had an email gateway solution in place and were providing email security training, but we were still riddled with phishing scams,"" said Wendi Iglesias, CIO at The Keyes Company. ""With Cyren Inbox Security, we're seeing a clear improvement in the detection of phishing emails. Overall, it's definitely reducing our number of successful phishing attacks and account takeovers.""

In July, Microsoft obtained a court order to seize six domains that were used in illegal phishing operations targeted at Microsoft 365 customers, including campaigns focused around Coronavirus and COVID-19. Phishing emails are often designed to trick users into providing their corporate usernames and passwords which allow hackers to log into a corporate email account and launch a business email compromise (BEC) attack on unsuspecting colleagues who think the emails are legitimate. According to an April 2020 FBI public service announcement, such attacks have led to ransomware and wire fraud cases, and the FBI estimates that BEC attacks in the U.S. have contributed to more than $2.1 billion in losses.

Cyren's recent customer wins include:

* An international beverage manufacturer rolled out Cyren Inbox Security to 10,000 users to address phishing across all of the organization's Microsoft 365 mailboxes

* A large educational institution with thousands of Microsoft 365 accounts deployed CIS to protect business operations as well as educational users

* A US-based real estate company with over 3,500 agents deployed CIS and experienced a signficant reduction in account takeover attempts and time spent resolving phishing incidents

* A manufacturing company who was experiencing a serious ransomware attack, evaluated CIS and rolled-out to all its users within a week

* A European software company, despite having an existing secure email gateway in place, deployed CIS in less than 7 days to address a serious ongoing phishing problem

""We are very satisfied with the early progress and market validation that Cyren Inbox Security has achieved in the market,"" said Lior Kohavi, Cyren's Chief Strategy Officer. ""With phishing and BEC attacks on the rise and over 200 million Microsoft 365 mailboxes in production, we know there is a very large market opportunity for a phishing solution that can protect enterprises and eliminate down time. Cyren is focused on helping businesses reduce expenses from fraudulent activity as well as time spent wasted on incident remediation.""

Cyren Inbox Security can be provisioned on any Microsoft 365 account in a matter of minutes. For more details on CIS features and benefits, to request a quote or to start a free 30 day trial, please visit https://www.cyren.com/inbox-security-free-trial.

250,PNJL000020150524eb5o0003g,"Video-sharing service gets new name, features","new york — In the mid-1990s, a lifetime ago in the Internet age, RealNetworks was a pioneer.

Online streaming of audio and video may be commonplace nowadays, but that certainly wasn't so in 1995 when RealNetworks launched what was to become the RealPlayer media app.","The ensuing years haven't been all that kind to RealNetworks, though the Seattle-based company has managed to stay afloat despite sinking revenue.

Since 2013, founder Rob Glaser, now in his second stint as RealNetworks' CEO, has been trying to engineer a turnaround via a new approach, RealPlayer Cloud, an online video-sharing service that claims about 11.5 million registered users.

The RealPlayer Cloud now has new name, RealTimes, and an expanded set of features that Glaser hopes will appeal in particular to parents who take tons of pictures and videos of their kids — in other words, practically every mom and dad with a smartphone.

""This is the most significant product launch since I came back,"" Glaser says.

RealNetwork's mission is simple but not exactly novel — use the RealTimes app to lift your photos and videos off the camera roll and turn them into brief RealTime Stories, essentially slideshows and video montages backed up with a soundtrack. Such stories can be easily shared on Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp, with other destinations including YouTube promised in the near future.

As an added bonus, you get some online storage to back up your photos online. Content is organized by date and location. You can share albums with friends who are notified when new photos and videos are added.

You're probably thinking that there are already numerous ways to accomplish such feats, either through third-party apps or via the software built into your devices. And you'd be correct.

In producing video montages, RealTimes' approach is to largely automate the process, getting you in Glaser's estimation about 80% of the way to a finished story. The app grabs pictures from a particular event or trip — Junior's Little League game, the family picnic — and suggests them as stories. But rather than choose every photo or video from a given event or place for the montage, the app eliminates duplicates or blurry photos.

The story may be fine, as is. Otherwise, it's left to you to manually add pictures that were omitted, delete others or to alter the soundtrack; some royalty-free music tracks are supplied with the app.

You can also change titles, apply transitions and some Instagram-like filters, and rearrange the order of the images and videos.

The company is going with a free and tiered pricing model. Under the free plan, stories are limited to 30 seconds in length and can be played back and streamed in standard resolution. You can pick among five transitions and filters and 10 tracks of music. You get 2 gigabytes of free storage and an additional 5GB if you upload your pictures to the cloud. You can hold 1,000 photos.

A step-up $4.99 a month ($49.99 a year) plan ups the storage to 25GB, for playback or streaming in high-definition; it also lets you exploit all available transitions and filters. You can increase the duration of a story to three minutes and can choose from 100 tracks of music. You can store 10,000 pictures. You also have the option of removing a ""watermark from the bottom right corner of a video.

The $9.99 a month ($99.99 a year) plan adds unlimited storage, the ability to choose from all the tracks in your library and lets you produce a story of any duration. If you're not under a subscription plan, you can lengthen a video story on a case-by-case basis by paying 99 cents each time.

The RealTimes app is available as a free download on Android phones and tablets, the iPhone and iPad, Windows PCs, Roku TV players, and Chromecast. It's promised soon on Macs, Amazon's Fire Phone, Fire TV, Kindle Fire, and on the Xbox One.

I do have a few quibbles. The biggest: I wish the app were a little smarter about how it chooses the photos used in a story. For example, before a recent game at Yankee Stadium, I snapped a picture of a sign in the parking lot so I could remember where I left my car. The picture seemed out of place in the RealStories montage that the app produced.

RealTimes isn't groundbreaking. But I can recommend the app and service to non-techie parents seeking an easy way to make photo and video memories come alive.

The $9.99 a month ($99.99 a year) plan adds unlimited storage, the ability to choose from all the tracks in your library and lets you produce a story of any duration. If you're not under a subscription plan, you can lengthen a video story on a case-by-case basis by paying 99 cents each time.

The RealTimes app is available as a free download on Android phones and tablets, the iPhone and iPad, Windows PCs, Roku TV players, and Chromecast. It's promised soon on Macs, Amazon's Fire Phone, Fire TV, Kindle Fire, and on the Xbox One.

I do have a few quibbles. The biggest: I wish the app were a little smarter about how it chooses the photos used in a story. For example, before a recent game at Yankee Stadium, I snapped a picture of a sign in the parking lot so I could remember where I left my car. The picture seemed out of place in the RealStories montage that the app produced.

RealTimes isn't groundbreaking. But I can recommend the app and service to non-techie parents seeking an easy way to make photo and video memories come alive.

416,BTRR000020200615eg6f00001,Adaptiva; Adaptiva Introduces OneSite Cloud - Enabling Secure Internet P2P Content Delivery to Empower Enterprises With Remote Workforces,"2020 JUN 15 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Bioterrorism Week -- Adaptiva, a leading, global provider of endpoint management and security solutions for enterprise customers, announced OneSite Cloud as enterprises accelerate digital transformation and the move to modern management. This latest OneSite offering enables users to receive software and other content updates at unprecedented speed and scale from wherever they are without overwhelming the corporate VPN and WAN/SD-WAN links or compromising network performance - only an internet connection is required. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200603005241/en/OneSite Cloud quickly and reliably delivers content - Win32 patches and software - to endpoints, no matter where they are in the world."," (Graphic: Business Wire) OneSite Cloud debuts as leading enterprises increasingly recognize the benefits of cloud-based solutions, including greater flexibility, lower costs, and the ability to modernize their endpoint management systems. Many view the move to modern management as vital for the future of their business; however, substantial concerns about the scalability and reliability of software delivery have slowed digital transformation. Adaptiva's OneSite Cloud effectively addresses these issues, clearing a path for enterprises to move forward.

The introduction of OneSite Cloud also comes amid a newfound sense of urgency as enterprises look to support their remote workforce without sacrificing security or performance. Adaptiva's global customer base has reported that in just the past two months, the number of employees who are working remotely has grown exponentially, placing an enormous strain on corporate VPN infrastructure that could be alleviated with a responsive cloud-based solution, such as OneSite Cloud.

""We've worked closely with our customers to design solutions around their emerging needs, and OneSite Cloud effectively delivers enterprise agility while unburdening the existing corporate networks,"" said Adaptiva CEO and Founder Deepak Kumar. ""They see that modern management is the future, and Adaptiva provides a path to get there without compromise."" OneSite Cloud Benefits Adaptiva OneSite is a single-download content delivery solution that dramatically speeds software deployment, increases distribution reliability, and reduces network impact by leveraging Adaptiva's industry-leading, highly secure peer-to-peer technology. Through support for Azure, the new OneSite Cloud offering provides a number of distinct performance benefits and industry-first capabilities that solve customer pain points, including: Software delivery everywhere: Whether working in an office, at home, from Starbucks or on-site with a customer, employees can still receive content, such as software, updates and patches, on their machines and devices as soon as it is deployed. Internet P2P content sharing capabilities: Now, with dual-mode communications - UDP and HTTP - endpoints can share content without a VPN regardless of where they are located in the world. VPN offload: OneSite Cloud supports split tunnel VPN architecture, enabling endpoints to get content directly from other internet-facing computers or from the Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) rather than overloading the corporate VPN concentrators by downloading software over the VPN. WAN offload: OneSite Cloud endpoints can get content directly from other internet-facing computers or from the Azure CDN, completely eliminating the need for content delivery on the corporate network and VPN. BYOD support: OneSite Cloud supports BYOD and does not require the endpoint to be joined to a Microsoft domain. Instead, an admin can simply email a link to the Adaptiva client to enable any machine to work with the network. This is particularly important for employees who are relying on home computers, personal devices, or new machines that have not been configured by corporate IT during the pandemic. Users can get up and running quickly while networks stay protected.

""Legacy remote access technology is failing to meet the needs of today's dynamic remote work scenarios,"" said ESG Senior Analyst Mark Bowker. ""Adaptiva is helping businesses eliminate their reliance on VPNs for secure access with a modern approach that aligns with the agility IT requires to deliver a reliable and secure end-user experience."" OneSite for Every Architecture - from Traditional to Modern Adaptiva also announced that starting today, OneSite Cloud customers will be able to leverage any version of OneSite that fits their current business needs at no additional cost - whether it is traditional on-premise, OneSite VMware Edition, OneSite Intune Edition or OneSite Cloud. This ensures that OneSite will expand seamlessly as business needs change and companies transition to modern management.

""Adaptiva has innovated quickly during this turbulent time to partner with our customers every step of the way,"" added Kumar. ""We've designed our products to work dynamically, regardless of where an enterprise wants to go and how it wants to get there. As an increasing number of global enterprises transition to the cloud, our product lines will offer compelling solutions that solve real problems.""

84,NVADAI0020200822eg8l00002,"Nevada launches contact tracing app to anonymously alert visitors, residents of possible COVID-19 exposures","The state of Nevada is launching an app on Monday that will allow people who have tested positive for COVID-19 to discreetly notify their close contacts of a possible exposure, a potentially significant boon in a tourism-driven state that has until this point had little ability to contact trace its visitors and at times even struggled to trace all its residents.

The contact tracing app, called COVID Trace, will be entirely opt-in, meaning that not only will users have to download the app in order to take advantage of its functionality, but those who test positive for COVID-19 will have to take an additional step in the app to notify those they may have come in contact with of a possible exposure.","Julia Peek, deputy administrator for the Division of Public and Behavioral Health, framed the app as a key tool in helping the state combat the spread of COVID-19 during a presentation of the app to reporters on Friday.

""Please help your neighbors, friends, family, stay safe and healthy by downloading the COVID Trace and encouraging others to download it as well,"" Peek said. ""It's an awesome opportunity for Nevadans, and our visitors to do more, one more thing to continue the fight against COVID to protect themselves and move Nevada to reopening fully again.""

The app, which was developed by a team of former Google and Uber engineers, leans on underlying technology developed jointly by Google and Apple earlier this year to assist states in phone-based contact tracing efforts. It will be available for public download through the Apple App Store and Google Play Stores and will be in both English and Spanish, depending on the user's settings.

Release of the Nevada app comes on the heels of launches of similar apps in Virginia and Alabama this month.

The way it will work is this: When two phones are in close contact, they will exchange and store anonymous tokens via Bluetooth. Each person's phone will then scan the cloud continuously to see whether any of the tokens attached to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 is a match against the tokens their phone has stored.

When Person A tests positive for COVID-19, they will receive a call from a disease investigator who will walk them through the contact tracing process and provide a unique code for Person A to enter into the app, if Person A has been using it and wants the app to notify their close contacts. Once that code is entered, Person A's phone will share their token anonymously with the cloud.

If Person B has been in close contact with Person A in the last 14 days, when Person B's phone scans the cloud and downloads the tokens of those who have tested positive, it will find a match against the tokens it has stored. Person B will then receive a notification alerting them that they were in close proximity to someone who tested positive for COVID-19 and the date of that exposure, but they will not be told Person A's identity.

In fact, app developers and state officials say the app will neither collect nor store any personal information, including a user's name, location, phone number and health information. State officials have said that the Nevada attorney general's office was involved in each step of the process of developing the app to ensure the proper consumer protections were in place.

Users will have to consent to both turning on the underlying contact tracing interface built into their phones by Apple or Google and receiving notifications as part of the process of setting up the app.

""The first thing that we want to emphasize is the privacy and really hit home the fact that there's very little of anything at all, that we know about you,"" said Dudley Carr, developer of COVID Trace. ""We don't know your location. We don't know who you are. We don't know the contacts on your phone. That's a common misconception. Contact tracing is about touch. It is not about who your contacts are. It doesn't have any of your health information and it certainly doesn't share that with anybody else.""

The app uses an algorithm to determine whether two people have been in close contact. For instance, it weighs five minutes of extremely close contact differently than it does 20 minutes of more distant but still close contact using the strength of the phones' Bluetooth signals.

""It weights those experiences and does an accumulation of that in order to determine an aggregate of exposure of 15 minutes for the day,"" Carr said. ""Unfortunately it's fairly complicated but what it tries to do is it says, all of these experiences together is the equivalent of being near someone with COVID-19 for 15 minutes over the course of the day, and then it alerts you based on that.""

However, the success of the app will largely depend on how many people download it, as it cannot perform its contact tracing functions unless both the person who tests positive for COVID-19 and the person who is exposed to COVID-19 have the app downloaded on their phones before the exposure occurs.

Creation of the app was spearheaded by the COVID-19 Response, Relief and Recovery Task Force, which was announced by Gov. Steve Sisolak in March and has focused on mobilizing private sector interests to aid in the state's coronavirus response. PLAYSTUDIOS, the mobile slot game developer, fully underwrote the cost of developing the app.

Former MGM Resorts CEO Jim Murren, who chairs the task force, said they are talking to ""large- and medium-sized employers"" about the app and that ""several dozen companies"" across the state, including MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment, are going through the process of not only adopting the app but pushing information out about it through their media channels.

""They believe that not only is this important for their employees but for the community itself and so to the extent that MGM or, let's say, Caesars, who I had a robust discussion with this week have said, if we can use our media channels, our media contacts, our assets to help communicate that this is an effective tool to help the people of Nevada, we'd be honored to do so,"" Murren said.

Murren said that he expects to hear more about the app from many of Nevada's large employers and representatives of organized labor, as well as those in the public sector and in the sports and entertainment field.

""Stay tuned,"" he said. ""But I could also say, no one has said no to me yet.""

The app could provide a significant boost to the state's capacity to contact trace among visitors, which has so far been limited. As early as June, local health districts acknowledged that tracing all of a visitor's interactions through multiple casino properties over the course of the weekend wasn't feasible, and the data show how few cases among visitors who tested positive for COVID-19 after returning home are ever reported to the state for contact tracing purposes.

The state also struggled last month to keep up with its contact tracing efforts among residents as the state was inundated with thousands of new COVID-19 cases. Southern Nevada Health District officials said last week that they are now contacting all new cases within 24 to 48 hours of receiving their positive lab report, though they continue to work through contacting all backlogged cases from July.","Nevada launches contact tracing app to anonymously alert visitors, residents of possible COVID-19 exposures The state of Nevada is launching an app on Monday that will allow people who have tested positive for COVID-19 to discreetly notify their close contacts of a possible exposure, a potentially significant boon in a tourism-driven state that has until this point had little ability to contact trace its visitors and at times even struggled to trace all its residents.

298,DAYBSJ0020180821ee8l0002t,Growing defense firm lands $24M in new military work,"One of the fastest growing companies in the Dayton region has secured more than $24 million in new military work.

Fairborn-based Peerless Technologies Corp. landed a U.S. Air Force project that involves modeling and simulation software development, operation and sustainment, the Department of Defense announced.","As part of the five-year contract, Peerless will provide the design, analysis, development, operation and sustainment of both commercial and non-commercial software products to ""better provide and improve the nuclear enterprise's analytic and decision making capabilities,"" according to the DoD.

The award was the result of a competitive acquisition, and Peerless beat out six other companies for the project. Work will be performed in Fairborn, and is expected to be completed by Aug. 26, 2023.

The contract is significant because it brings in more work for Peerless, and could result in an employment boost. It also helps strengthen the company's relationship with the Air Force, and is a win for the Dayton region because all work will be conducted locally.

Founded in 2000, Peerless provides systems engineering, cybersecurity, IT, human performance, medical, and innovation and research support services. The company has 313 total employees, including 150 locally.

The firm brought in $67.2 million in revenue in 2017, a 24 percent jump from 2016. The revenue boost made Peerless one of the 20 fastest growing companies in the Dayton area, according to DBJ research.

106,JOENG00020150730eb7u00195,Computer Companies; Patent Issued for Bitline Deletion,"2015 AUG 5 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Journal of Engineering -- A patent by the inventors Ambroladze, Ekaterina M. (Wappingers Falls, NY); Blake, Michael A. (Wappingers Falls, NY); Fee, Michael (Cold Spring, NY); Huynh, Hieu T. (Austin, NY); Meaney, Patrick J. (Poughkeepsie, NY); O'Neill, Arthur J. (Poughkeepsie, NY), filed on March 7, 2013, was published online on July 21, 2015, according to news reporting originating from Alexandria, Virginia, by VerticalNews correspondents.

Patent number 9086990 is assigned to International Business Machines Corporation (Armonk, NY).","The following quote was obtained by the news editors from the background information supplied by the inventors: ""The present invention relates generally to memory in a computing system, and more specifically, to handling errors in memory.

""Computer systems often have a considerable amount of cache and high speed random access memory (RAM) to hold information, such as data and programs, temporarily when a computer is powered and operational. This information is normally binary, composed of patterns of 1's and 0's known as bits of data. The bits of data are often grouped and organized at a higher level. A byte, for example, is typically composed of 8 bits; more generally these groups or bytes are called symbols and may consist of any number of bits or sub-symbols.

""Memory device densities have continued to grow as computer systems have become more powerful. Unfortunately, the failure of just a portion of a memory device, such as a cache or RAM, can lead to significantly reduced performance. When memory errors occur, which may be 'hard' (repeating) or 'soft' (one-time or intermittent) failures, these failures may occur as single cell, multi-bit, wordline or bitlines and may cause all or part of the memory device to be unusable until it is repaired.

""In the case of failures in a cache, a failure of a bitline is a hard error that causes errors each time a line that includes the failed bitline is accessed. In some cases, the failed bitline, in addition to a correctable error (CE) in the same line, will result in an uncorrectable two bit error (UE).

Copyright 2015, NewsRx LLC","Computer Companies; Patent Issued for Bitline Deletion 2015 AUG 5 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Journal of Engineering -- A patent by the inventors Ambroladze, Ekaterina M. (Wappingers Falls, NY); Blake, Michael A. (Wappingers Falls, NY); Fee, Michael (Cold Spring, NY); Huynh, Hieu T. (Austin, NY); Meaney, Patrick J. (Poughkeepsie, NY); O'Neill, Arthur J. (Poughkeepsie, NY), filed on March 7, 2013, was published online on July 21, 2015, according to news reporting originating from Alexandria, Virginia, by VerticalNews correspondents.

Patent number 9086990 is assigned to International Business Machines Corporation (Armonk, NY). The following quote was obtained by the news editors from the background information supplied by the inventors: ""The present invention relates generally to memory in a computing system, and more specifically, to handling errors in memory.

""Computer systems often have a considerable amount of cache and high speed random access memory (RAM) to hold information, such as data and programs, temporarily when a computer is powered and operational. This information is normally binary, composed of patterns of 1's and 0's known as bits of data. The bits of data are often grouped and organized at a higher level. A byte, for example, is typically composed of 8 bits; more generally these groups or bytes are called symbols and may consist of any number of bits or sub-symbols.

""Memory device densities have continued to grow as computer systems have become more powerful. Unfortunately, the failure of just a portion of a memory device, such as a cache or RAM, can lead to significantly reduced performance. When memory errors occur, which may be 'hard' (repeating) or 'soft' (one-time or intermittent) failures, these failures may occur as single cell, multi-bit, wordline or bitlines and may cause all or part of the memory device to be unusable until it is repaired.

""In the case of failures in a cache, a failure of a bitline is a hard error that causes errors each time a line that includes the failed bitline is accessed. In some cases, the failed bitline, in addition to a correctable error (CE) in the same line, will result in an uncorrectable two bit error (UE). Thus, cache performance is adversely affected by a failed bitline, as it may cause CEs that would ordinarily be quickly corrected by ECC to require additional processes to access the correct data or result in corrupted data.""

437,COMWKN0020170831ed8v000k0,"Patents; Researchers Submit Patent Application, ""Alerts for a Virtualization Environment"", for Approval (USPTO 20170235594)","2017 SEP 6 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Computer Weekly News -- From Washington, D.C., VerticalNews journalists report that a patent application by the inventors Vankadaru, Deepak (San Jose, CA); Dasa Lakshminarayana, Deepthi (San Jose, CA); Mysore Guruprasad, Karthik (Santa Clara, CA); Sundhararajan, Sundarakumar (San Jose, CA); Lee, Ting Suk (Cupertino, CA), filed on February 3, 2017, was made available online on August 24, 2017.

No assignee for this patent application has been made.","News editors obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: ""A virtual machine ('VM') may refer to a specific software-based implementation of a machine in a virtualization environment, in which the hardware resources of a real computer (e.g., CPU, memory, etc.) are virtualized or transformed into the underlying support for the fully functional virtual machine that can run its own operating system and applications on the underlying physical resources just like a real computer.

""Virtualization works by inserting a thin layer of software directly on the computer hardware or on a host operating system. This layer of software contains a virtual machine monitor or 'hypervisor' that allocates hardware resources dynamically and transparently. Multiple operating systems run concurrently on a single physical computer and share hardware resources with each other. By encapsulating an entire machine, including CPU, memory, operating system, and network devices, a virtual machine is completely compatible with most standard operating systems, applications, and device drivers. Most modern implementations allow several operating systems and applications to safely run at the same time on a single computer, with each having access to the resources it needs when it needs them.

""Virtualization allows one to run multiple virtual machines on a single physical machine, with each virtual machine sharing the resources of that one physical computer across multiple environments. Different virtual machines can run different operating systems and multiple applications on the same physical computer.

""One reason for the broad adoption of virtualization in modern business and computing environments is the resource utilization advantages provided by virtual machines. Without virtualization, if a physical machine is limited to a single dedicated operating system, then during periods of inactivity by the dedicated operating system the physical machine is not utilized to perform useful work. This is wasteful and inefficient if there are users on other physical machines which are currently waiting for computing resources. To address this problem, virtualization allows multiple VMs to share the underlying physical resources so that during periods of inactivity by one VM, other VMs can take advantage of the resource availability to process workloads. This can produce great efficiencies for the utilization of physical computing devices, and can result in reduced redundancies and better resource cost management.

""Furthermore, certain virtualization environments may not only utilize the processing power of the physical computing devices, but also to aggregate storage capacity across the individual physical computing devices to create a logical storage pool wherein the data is distributed across the physical computing devices, yet appears to the virtual machines to be part of the system that the virtual machine is hosted on. Such systems may utilize metadata, which may be distributed and replicated any number of times across the system, to locate specific data within the logical storage pool. These systems are commonly referred to as clustered systems, wherein the resources of the group are pooled to provide logically combined, but physically separate systems.""

As a supplement to the background information on this patent application, VerticalNews correspondents also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent application: ""Particular embodiments provide an architecture for implementing a graphical user interface ('GUI') and a framework for enabling alert configuration for entities and/or resources in a virtualization environment. Particular embodiments may also provide mechanism to modify the alert configuration on a per-cluster basis to suit the requirements of a cluster. The framework may comprise a central module for storing and managing information about alerts, as well as handling alerts, and a number of element modules on the nodes for implementing alerts, handling alerts, and sending status information back to the central module. The framework may determine when and whether to generate an alert, what severity level has been triggered, and what should be done once an alert has been generated. Information triggering alerts may come from any number of sources or services in the virtualization environment. The central module and/or the element modules may assess the information (e.g., the fan speed is high, which means that it may be getting too hot; or the disk usage is getting high, which means that one or more nodes may be approaching the capacity limit), then determine what action to take. In particular embodiments, the framework may provide default values for alert rules, as well as the ability to establish exceptions to the default values. In particular embodiments, the GUI may group together similar exceptions, and such exceptions may be configured on a per-cluster, per-entity, or per-resource basis. Specific clusters, elements, and/or resources may be associated with existing or new exceptions from a centralized location, on a per-alert basis. Particular embodiments may facilitate exploring various time series metrics which can help in analyzing an alert. Particular embodiments may gather all relevant metrics and present the information in a single GUI.

""Particular embodiments may provide a rule-based mechanism to send out notifications (e.g., by email) when an alert is triggered. Particular embodiments may provide a subscription mechanism to enable end-users (e.g., systems administrators) to subscribe to different categories or types of alerts. The recipients of these notifications (e.g., a global recipient list) may be specified via a GUI and/or by command-line entry or a script. Particular embodiments provide a notification rule mechanism to subscribe to alert notifications based on the severity, category and originating cluster (in case of the central module). Multiple rules may be specified. When an alert is raised, the notification is sent to recipients of all rules that match the severity, category and cluster criteria. If none of the rules match, the notification is sent by default to the global recipient list. In particular embodiments, the end-user may be able to modify the order in which the notification subscription rules are applied. In addition, end-users may be able to terminate further rule processing if any rule matches with an alert.

""Further details of aspects, objects, and advantages of the invention are described below in the detailed description, drawings, and claims.

This legislation would forbid the FCC from regulating the retail rates charged by Internet Service Providers (ISPs).

""Today's legislation, H.R. 2666, is needed to ensure that the Obama Administration sticks to their initial promise of not regulating broadband rates.

""If we are to allow the FCC to interfere in the Internet marketplace in such a way, we discourage investment, intimidate innovators, and could forfeit upwards of 43,000 jobs. As a member of the Communications & Technology subcommittee on Energy & Commerce, it's our responsibility to place checks and balances on unruly government agencies. We're simply fulfilling our duty as legislators today by reining in the FCC's abuse of power.""

Background:

As stated in this fact sheet from the Energy & Commerce Committee:

* According to a study commissioned by the United States Telecom Association, FCC rules regulating broadband services could cost 43,560 jobs.

Why is this legislation important?

* Rate regulation, or the threat of potential rate regulation, creates significant uncertainty for ISPs and as a result, discourages investment and unique pricing structures or service plans.

* Rate regulation, whether by rule or by enforcement, can prevent providers from offering pro-consumer service plans.

* Despite prior promises, Chairman Wheeler admitted at a March 2016 hearing that the FCC should have the authority to regulate broadband rates. Watch the video https://energycommerce.house.gov/news-center/press-releases/chairman-wheeler-admits-fcc-should-have-ability-regulate-broadband-rates.

Conservatives know price-fixing doesn't work, and internet service is no exception.

""If we are to allow the FCC to interfere in the Internet marketplace in such a way, we discourage investment, intimidate innovators, and could forfeit upwards of 43,000 jobs. As a member of the Communications & Technology subcommittee on Energy & Commerce, it's our responsibility to place checks and balances on unruly government agencies. We're simply fulfilling our duty as legislators today by reining in the FCC's abuse of power.""

Background:

As stated in this fact sheet from the Energy & Commerce Committee:

* According to a study commissioned by the United States Telecom Association, FCC rules regulating broadband services could cost 43,560 jobs.

Why is this legislation important?

* Rate regulation, or the threat of potential rate regulation, creates significant uncertainty for ISPs and as a result, discourages investment and unique pricing structures or service plans.

* Rate regulation, whether by rule or by enforcement, can prevent providers from offering pro-consumer service plans.

* Despite prior promises, Chairman Wheeler admitted at a March 2016 hearing that the FCC should have the authority to regulate broadband rates. Watch the video https://energycommerce.house.gov/news-center/press-releases/chairman-wheeler-admits-fcc-should-have-ability-regulate-broadband-rates.

361,CNEWSN0020190812ef8c0008f,Firefox's new stylized logo is starting to arrive,"Mozilla has released a new test version of its web browser that introduces the new Firefox logo and drops ""Quantum"" from its name.

Mozilla long ago moved the Firefox icon to a more stylized look, but the newest version is another step away from the original drawing of a fox wrapped around the globe. Even though the fox's face is now in view and its limbs have vanished, it's still easily recognized.","The new icon arrived over the weekend in version 70 of Firefox Nightly, the incarnation designed for people who want to test the latest features and who can put up with crashes or other problems. Firefox Nightly will settle down into a beta version in coming weeks, then into the main version everyone gets a few weeks after that.

The logo in Firefox Nightly has a different blue/purple color scheme. The regular Firefox will stick with the red, orange and yellow colors.

Also in the new version is a splash screen that says just ""Firefox browser"" instead of the ""Firefox Quantum"" that's been around since the November 2017 release of Firefox 57. That Quantum branding effort signified a major effort to speed up Firefox to better compete with Google's Chrome, which dominates browser usage. At the time, Mozilla said the Quantum brand wasn't necessarily a permanent change.

Mozilla's newest challenge to Chrome centers on protecting your privacy online -- for example by blocking websites and online ads that try to track you. Chrome has lagged other browsers like Safari, Firefox and Brave in that regard.

Mozilla didn't immediately comment.

The much awaited ICO to buy the cryptocurrency is a golden opportunity for investors to benefit from a project that is a big step towards fulfilling the dream of decentralizing the internet. According to the formulated plan, 95% of the total 5 million PLS tokens will be sold to investors, whereas the remaining 5% are reserved for the development team.

Virek McCleary, head of outreach for SecuredBySense, stated:

“For as long as computer have been and will be in existence; whether connected to the internet or not; there will always be an increasing need for internet security software. There won’t be a time when people, whether mischievous youths looking for a thrill or hardened internet criminals looking to exploit billion-dollar companies, will stop looking for new ways to commit fraud, cause widespread damage, or just experience the rush of breaking into a computer.”

People all over the world use computers and all over the world people have their lives changed because of computer viruses and cyber-criminals. Viruses have a tendency to be harmful causing difficult situations such as identity theft, fraud, and many variants of hardware and software damage.

“There is very much a proposed solution to an outstanding unsolved problem. This will prevent security breaches, protect personal information, and the further development of the internet security field,” he added.

Once launched, SecuredBySense might prove to be a revolutionary platform that facilitates and promotes the blockchain community across the globe.

66,JOENG00020161205ecc5001ry,"Leidos, Inc. Patent Issued for System and Method for Correlating Cloud-Based Big Data in Real-Time for Intelligent Analytics and Multiple End Uses (USPTO 9501535)","2016 DEC 5 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Journal of Engineering -- From Alexandria, Virginia, VerticalNews journalists report that a patent by the inventors Cannaliato, Thomas James (Sykesville, MD); Decker, Joshua A. (Severna Park, MD); Vahlberg, Matthew William (Severna Park, MD), filed on July 27, 2015, was published online on November 22, 2016.

The patent's assignee for patent number 9501535 is Leidos, Inc. (Reston, VA).","News editors obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: ""The problem to be solved generally, is how to manage and analyze big data, e.g., on the order of petabytes of data. Big data is broadly defined as data sets with sizes beyond the ability of commonly-used software tools to capture, curate, manage, and process the data within a reasonable amount of time. The world's information doubles approximately every two years. This information (or data) includes critical intelligence, but the mining of such intelligence becomes cost prohibitive and takes too long for many end-users and applications. Whereas traditional data sets include narrow subsets of historical, structured, static data populating relational databases; big data presents a particularly difficult problem for end-users as it is unlimited, may be both structured and unstructured, is frequently available in real-time and may be iterative. Such big data is simply too much for the present relational database management systems without significant processing, which is time consuming and ultimately renders much of the data outdated and of limited value.

""FIG. 1 illustrates an existing process for correlating data. As shown, multiple exemplary data sets D.sub.1 to D.sub.4 from various sources are loaded onto separate databases (DB.sub.1 to DB.sub.4) for separate access by an application or user (hereafter 'user'). Additional contextual data to augment the relevance of sources D.sub.1 through D.sub.4 are accessible directly to the user (D.sub.5 and D.sub.6). The user must correlate and process the data from the data sets to generate a result. The report generation process is time consuming and highly manual, requiring a large investment of time from the user.

""A number of existing data warehousing techniques address the backend correlation changes of scenarios such as depicted in FIG. 1 Dimensional modeling has been used to organize data in a data warehouse to increase its analytical value and support end-user queries by adding dimension data to fact data to provide context. This is described in multiple papers by Ralph Kimball; see, for example, 'A Dimensional Modeling Manifesto' Aug. 2, 1997, Kimball Group (www.kimballgroup.com), which is incorporate herein by reference in its entirety. While the dimensional modeling technique is available to structure the data after it is saved in DB.sub.1 to DB.sub.4 to support end user queries, this is a backend technique.

""Accordingly, there is a need in the art for an improved system and method for front end processing of big data for near real-time availability for alerting, query and analysis by one or more users.""

As a supplement to the background information on this patent, VerticalNews correspondents also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: ""In a first exemplary embodiments, a process for data collection and conditioning is described. The process includes: receiving multiple data records from multiple data sources at a processing engine, wherein the multiple data records have different formats from each other and from a pre-established internal data format; parsing in near real time by at least one parser each of the multiple data records into multiple constituent parts; translating in near real time by at least one translator each of the multiple data records using their parsed multiple constituent parts into a pre-established internal data format; comparing in near real time by the processing engine each of the multiple translated internal data records with at least a first enrichment rule to determine if the at least a first enrichment rule is applicable to the translated internal data record; if applicable, enriching in near real time by the processing engine the translated internal data record with additional data pursuant to the at least a first enrichment rule to form an enriched translated internal data record; and transmitting in near real time the enriched translated internal data record to at least one data sink for storage therein, wherein the enriched translated internal data record is available for use by multiple applications.

""In a second exemplary embodiment, a process for data collection and conditioning is described. The process includes: receiving multiple data records from multiple data sources at a processing engine; holding the received multiple data records in a first queue to await processing; pulling the received multiple data records off of the first queue by a designated number of ingest nodes for processing; monitoring continuously during the process at least one of first queue size and a rate at which received multiple data records are pulled off of the first queue; determining that the first queue size or rate are outside of an acceptable range; allocating or deallocating ingest nodes to or from the designated number of ingest nodes automatically during the process in accordance with the determination; transmitting from the designated number of ingest nodes in near real time the processed multiple data records to a second queue; holding the received processed multiple data records in the second queue; pulling the received processing multiple data records off of the second queue by a designated number of data sink nodes for processing; monitoring continuously during the process at least one of second queue size and a rate at which received processed multiple data records are pulled off of the second queue; determining that the second queue size or rate are outside of an acceptable range; allocating or deallocating data sink nodes to or from the designated number of data sink nodes automatically during the process in accordance with the determination; and transmitting in near real time each of the processed multiple data records to at least one of the multiple data sinks for storage therein, wherein the processed multiple data record are available for use by multiple applications.

""In a third exemplary embodiment, a system for data collection and conditioning is described.

Our reports deliver fact-based news of research and discoveries from around the world. Copyright 2016, NewsRx LLC","Leidos, Inc. Patent Issued for System and Method for Correlating Cloud-Based Big Data in Real-Time for Intelligent Analytics and Multiple End Uses (USPTO 9501535) 2016 DEC 5 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Journal of Engineering -- From Alexandria, Virginia, VerticalNews journalists report that a patent by the inventors Cannaliato, Thomas James (Sykesville, MD); Decker, Joshua A. (Severna Park, MD); Vahlberg, Matthew William (Severna Park, MD), filed on July 27, 2015, was published online on November 22, 2016.

The patent's assignee for patent number 9501535 is Leidos, Inc. (Reston, VA). News editors obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: ""The problem to be solved generally, is how to manage and analyze big data, e.g., on the order of petabytes of data. Big data is broadly defined as data sets with sizes beyond the ability of commonly-used software tools to capture, curate, manage, and process the data within a reasonable amount of time. The world's information doubles approximately every two years. This information (or data) includes critical intelligence, but the mining of such intelligence becomes cost prohibitive and takes too long for many end-users and applications. Whereas traditional data sets include narrow subsets of historical, structured, static data populating relational databases; big data presents a particularly difficult problem for end-users as it is unlimited, may be both structured and unstructured, is frequently available in real-time and may be iterative. Such big data is simply too much for the present relational database management systems without significant processing, which is time consuming and ultimately renders much of the data outdated and of limited value.

""FIG. 1 illustrates an existing process for correlating data. As shown, multiple exemplary data sets D.sub.1 to D.sub.4 from various sources are loaded onto separate databases (DB.sub.1 to DB.sub.4) for separate access by an application or user (hereafter 'user'). Additional contextual data to augment the relevance of sources D.sub.1 through D.sub.4 are accessible directly to the user (D.sub.5 and D.sub.6). The user must correlate and process the data from the data sets to generate a result. The report generation process is time consuming and highly manual, requiring a large investment of time from the user.

""A number of existing data warehousing techniques address the backend correlation changes of scenarios such as depicted in FIG. 1 Dimensional modeling has been used to organize data in a data warehouse to increase its analytical value and support end-user queries by adding dimension data to fact data to provide context. This is described in multiple papers by Ralph Kimball; see, for example, 'A Dimensional Modeling Manifesto' Aug. 2, 1997, Kimball Group (www.kimballgroup.com), which is incorporate herein by reference in its entirety. While the dimensional modeling technique is available to structure the data after it is saved in DB.sub.1 to DB.sub.4 to support end user queries, this is a backend technique.

""Accordingly, there is a need in the art for an improved system and method for front end processing of big data for near real-time availability for alerting, query and analysis by one or more users.""

As a supplement to the background information on this patent, VerticalNews correspondents also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: ""In a first exemplary embodiments, a process for data collection and conditioning is described. The process includes: receiving multiple data records from multiple data sources at a processing engine, wherein the multiple data records have different formats from each other and from a pre-established internal data format; parsing in near real time by at least one parser each of the multiple data records into multiple constituent parts; translating in near real time by at least one translator each of the multiple data records using their parsed multiple constituent parts into a pre-established internal data format; comparing in near real time by the processing engine each of the multiple translated internal data records with at least a first enrichment rule to determine if the at least a first enrichment rule is applicable to the translated internal data record; if applicable, enriching in near real time by the processing engine the translated internal data record with additional data pursuant to the at least a first enrichment rule to form an enriched translated internal data record; and transmitting in near real time the enriched translated internal data record to at least one data sink for storage therein, wherein the enriched translated internal data record is available for use by multiple applications.

""In a second exemplary embodiment, a process for data collection and conditioning is described. The process includes: receiving multiple data records from multiple data sources at a processing engine; holding the received multiple data records in a first queue to await processing; pulling the received multiple data records off of the first queue by a designated number of ingest nodes for processing; monitoring continuously during the process at least one of first queue size and a rate at which received multiple data records are pulled off of the first queue; determining that the first queue size or rate are outside of an acceptable range; allocating or deallocating ingest nodes to or from the designated number of ingest nodes automatically during the process in accordance with the determination; transmitting from the designated number of ingest nodes in near real time the processed multiple data records to a second queue; holding the received processed multiple data records in the second queue; pulling the received processing multiple data records off of the second queue by a designated number of data sink nodes for processing; monitoring continuously during the process at least one of second queue size and a rate at which received processed multiple data records are pulled off of the second queue; determining that the second queue size or rate are outside of an acceptable range; allocating or deallocating data sink nodes to or from the designated number of data sink nodes automatically during the process in accordance with the determination; and transmitting in near real time each of the processed multiple data records to at least one of the multiple data sinks for storage therein, wherein the processed multiple data record are available for use by multiple applications.

74,KRTTU00020131126e9bq0003k,"Tech Tuesday: New Playstation, Xbox consoles see record debut","Nov. 26--Some tech pundits, myself included, wondered if the demand for new dedicated game consoles had shrunk compared to years past. We've reached diminishing returns on improving visuals, new features can be patched into existing consoles, and console game sales have been shrinking while smartphone and tablet game purchases have been exploding.

Looks like I had no reason to be pessimistic. Sony announced the PlayStation 4 sold 1 million units in just 24 hours. A week later after the release of the Xbox One, Microsoft announced that it too had cracked a million in a day. And yes, I'm hoping to review the One as soon as possible.","No matter how you slice it, those figures are amazing. No game system had ever sold that much on release -- the second-biggest was the release of the PlayStation 2, which sold just 500,000 in its first week. The two are off to a great start.

Now comes the story behind these numbers. Typically game console releases are restricted by supply, and they're sold out for weeks or months after they are released. There are some exceptions to this -- the $600 PlayStation 3 launch and the Wii U launch spring to mind -- but the majority of the initial sales equal the number of systems the companies manage to crank out.

Somehow, despite the increasingly complex technology, both Sony and Microsoft managed to build more consoles than anyone ever has before. That's an impressive feat.

And while the natural assumption would be to think that demand for both the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 are exactly the same, it might not be that clear-cut. The PlayStation 4 released in the United States first, and will spread to Europe and Australia later this week. Oddly, Japan doesn't get it until February.

Meanwhile, the Xbox One launched here, Europe and Australia on the same day. Microsoft got the same number, though they divided it among more countries.

And finally, there's launch-day excitement. Systems such as the Wii U or the old Sega Dreamcast can have strong launch weeks as fans buy them up but go on to weak sales after that. I'm not saying either the One or the PlayStation 4 will become sales dogs, but the true test of their popularity is yet to come.

But I don't want to rain on the parade. Sony and Microsoft's debuts more than lived up to the hype, and both systems are well worth keeping an eye on.

san francisco — Following up on its blockbuster release of Office for iPad earlier this year, Microsoft on Thursday unveiled new Office apps for iPhone and said consumers using any of its mobile apps would be able to create and edit Office documents for free.","The new apps for iPhone for Word, Excel and PowerPoint — Microsoft's iconic productivity suite — will replace the existing Office Mobile app. The apps on iPad are also getting an update.

Office software lets you create and edit documents, calculate spreadsheets and design presentations and graphics. Microsoft moved to a subscription model for Office last year. As of today, though, anyone using an Office mobile app on a smartphone or tablet can create and edit across the core apps for free. You'll still need an Office 365 subscription for premium features, including more advanced editing of Word docs, images and charts.

Also Thursday, Microsoft announced a ""preview"" of new Office apps for Android tablets. People will be able to sign up to join the preview at the Google Play store. General availability is likely early next year.

The moves are all part of Microsoft's recognition under CEO Satya Nadella that it must deliver services to businesses and consumers wherever they are, especially on mobile devices. The Office for iPad apps have racked up 40 million downloads since being announced in March.

""Our pace of change with Office over the last 12 months or so has been pretty phenomenal,"" says Microsoft Office exec Michael Atalla.

About 150 updates have gone out to Office apps across all platforms, about a third of them in the past three months.

The iPhone and iPad apps require iOS7 or later. Going forward, the apps will be updated ""in lockstep,"" Atalla said.

""They are literally the same code, the same features, the same apps.""

The Android tablet preview is aimed at allowing Microsoft's Office team to get a broad snapshot of consumer use on that platform. Android tablets run the gamut of screen sizes and other specs.

For now, there will remain an Office Mobile for Android phone app, which is similar to the current app on iPhone, Atalla said.

Forrester analyst TJ Keitt said allowing consumers to make basic Office edits without ponying up a subscription fee is ultimately a good move for Microsoft, which had been ceding some mobile productivity ground to Apple and Google, as well as upstarts like Evernote.

The new Office apps will include the Dropbox integration.

san francisco — Following up on its blockbuster release of Office for iPad earlier this year, Microsoft on Thursday unveiled new Office apps for iPhone and said consumers using any of its mobile apps would be able to create and edit Office documents for free. The new apps for iPhone for Word, Excel and PowerPoint — Microsoft's iconic productivity suite — will replace the existing Office Mobile app. The apps on iPad are also getting an update.

Office software lets you create and edit documents, calculate spreadsheets and design presentations and graphics. Microsoft moved to a subscription model for Office last year. As of today, though, anyone using an Office mobile app on a smartphone or tablet can create and edit across the core apps for free. You'll still need an Office 365 subscription for premium features, including more advanced editing of Word docs, images and charts.

Microsoft 3rd-Quarter Profit Up 19%, CFO to Depart","Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) fiscal third-quarter earnings rose 19% as the software giant's core Windows division reported higher sales, and the company also said Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein will leave the company at the end of the fiscal year.

It will announce a new CFO from its finance leadership team in the next several weeks. Mr. Klein was with Microsoft 11 years.","Microsoft has been squeezed by a shift in consumer and business spending to tablets and smartphones and away from PCs. The company, whose software is on a majority of the world's PCs, last fall introduced Windows 8, a completely overhauled operating system with touch-screen capabilities. Several companies in the industry were hoping Windows 8 would spark a revival in PC demand, though recent data has indicated the new operating system hasn't spurred much PC sales growth.

Microsoft's earnings report comes a week after two prominent research firms, IDC and Gartner Inc., released figures for the latest quarter that showed double-digit declines in PC shipments. To improve consumer demand, Microsoft is expected to adopt a new design methodology called Microsoft Blue, which could bring frequent regular updates to the operating system and other products.

The company has also been looking to expand its hardware offerings. Microsoft launched the Surface tablet-style computer last October and is preparing a similarly small model with a seven-inch display, The Wall Street Journal recently reported.

For the quarter ended March 31, Microsoft reported a profit of $6.06 billion, or 72 cents a share, up from $5.11 billion, or 60 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest quarter included a net revenue recognition of $1.67 billion for the Windows upgrade offer, Office upgrade Offer and pre-sales, and video game deferral. Excluding the revenue recognition and a European Commission fine, adjusted earnings were 65 cents a share in the latest period.

Revenue rose 18% to $20.49 billion. Adjusted revenue totaled $18.83 billion.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters most recently projected earnings of 68 cents a share and revenue of $20.5 billion.

Microsoft's Windows and Windows Live division saw revenue rise 23%.

Revenue for the company's servers and tools products, which form the backbone of enterprise networks and private clouds, was up 11%.

At the business division, which earns most of its sales from Microsoft Office, sales were up 8.2%.

Shares rose 19 cents to $29.98 after hours. Through the close, the stock has climbed 7.8% since the start of the year

202,PNN0000020191203efc200007,The Next Generation of VERICUT - Version 9.0,"Irvine, CA - CGTech is pleased to announce the latest release of VERICUT software, Version 9.0. VERICUT CNC machine simulation, verification, and optimization software simulates all types of CNC machining, additive, and hybrid manufacturing processes. The software operates independently, but can also be integrated with leading CAM systems.

“VERICUT 9.0 is ‘smarter' than previous versions, offering more robust connections to tooling databases and the latest CAM systems,” says Gene Granata, VERICUT Product Manager. “Most users will also experience gains in performance, especially when simulating Additive or hybrid AM operations. Enhancements to VERICUT's free Reviewer app lets programmers share with others (like machinists or Quality Assurance personnel) how parts are manufactured.”","VERICUT 9.0 features several enhancements designed to increase power and improve efficiency, including a new graphics engine. Users will experience sharper, clearer and more realistic views of machines and the machining process. Hundreds of customer-driven enhancements and software change requests were also completed.

Enhanced Graphics Display

VERICUT 9.0's greatly enhanced image quality makes it easier to spot problems and imperfections in machined parts. Switch seamlessly between Workpiece, Machine or Profile views, or combine them in a variety of view layouts.

Streamlined Verification

Any of VERICUT's major functions, such as AUTO-DIFF, Section, and X-Caliper, can be used in any view which streamlines the verification effort and increases productivity.

Force Optimization

Use Force “Analyze”, without any prior configuration, to spot potentially dangerous machining conditions or identify underutilized tools. Force Charts has a new “Fill Comparison” option to help visualize the changes made by Force optimization to feed rates and chip loads.

Appearance Settings

Appearance settings accompany the “Color” option for components and models, and can be used to add realism to objects in VERICUT simulations. Machined parts look more lifelike and identification of errors or incorrect cuts has become easier.

Enhanced Translucency and New Stock/Design View

New features are available to quickly display the Design part embedded in translucent Stock, and show AUTO-DIFF Gouge or Excess errors in relation to the Design part or cut stock model.

X-Caliper

X-Caliper has several new measurements, and features that provide greater control over how measurements (dimensions) are shown. Images with dimensions can be printed, saved to an image file, or utilized in Setup Plans.

Setup Plan

A new Setup Plan capability makes it easier than ever to create images from the simulation with dimensions or notes that help others understand the manufacturing process. Setup Plans are easily incorporated in VERICUT's reports to document operation setups, or how machined parts should look at various stages.

Multi-Tool Station

The new Multi-Tool Station tool component has been added in Tool Manager, enabling users to setup an apparatus that holds multiple tools, attached to a single turret station.

Tool Change List Panel

Tool Change List panel is enhanced with capabilities to graphically setup tools on turrets, in toolchains, define orientations for “Flash” multi-function tools, and more.

Reviewer App

VERICUT's Reviewer application is powered by the same enhanced graphics engine featured in VERICUT Verification, and users will also immediately notice the dramatic boost in performance.

New Section Window

The new Section window is easier to use with dynamic section plane locations and angle adjustments.

301,ARNEWS0020210112eh1c000m9,Content discovery platform Dable closes $12 million Series C at $90 million valuation to accelerate its global expansion,"Launched in South Korea five years ago, content discovery platform Dable now serves a total of six markets in Asia. Now it plans to speed up the pace of its expansion, with six new markets in the region planned for this year, before entering European countries and the United States. Dable announced today that it has raised a $12 million Series C at a valuation of $90 million, led by South Korean venture capital firm SV Investment. Other participants included KB Investment and K2 Investment, as well as returning investor Kakao Ventures, a subsidiary of Kakao Corporation, one of South Koreas largest internet firms.

Dable (the name is a combination of data and able) currently serves more than 2,500 media outlets in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia. It has subsidiaries in Taiwan, which accounts for 70% of its overseas sales, and Indonesia.","The Series C brings Dables total funding so far to $20.5 million. So far, the company has taken a gradual approach to international expansion, co-founder and chief executive officer Chaehyun Lee told TechCrunch, first entering one or two markets and then waiting for business there to stabilize. In 2021, however, it plans to use its Series C to speed up the pace of its expansion, launching in Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, mainland China, Australia and Turkey before entering markets in Europe and the United States, too.

The companys goal is to become the most utilized personalized recommendation platform in at last 30 countries by 2024. Lee said it also has plans to transform into a media tech company by launching a content management system (CMS) next year.

Dable currently claims an average annual sales growth rate since founding of more than 50%, and says it reached $27.5 million in sales in 2020, up from 63% the previous year. Each month, it has a total of 540 million unique users and recommends five billion pieces of content, resulting in more than 100 million clicks. Dable also says its average annual sales growth rate since founding is more than 50%, and in that 2020, it reached $27.5 million in sales, up 63% from the previous year.

Before launching Dable, Lee and three other members of its founding team worked at RecoPick, a recommendation engine developer operated by SK Telecom subsidiary SK Planet. For media outlets, Dable offers two big data and machine learning-based products: Dable News to make personalized recommendations of content, including articles, to visitors, and Dable Native Ad, which draws on ad networks including Google, MSN and Kakao.

A third product, called karamel.ai, is an ad-targeting solution for e-commerce platforms that also makes personalized product recommendations.

Dables main rivals include Taboola and Outbrain, both of which are headquartered in New York (and recently called off a merger), but also do business in Asian markets, and Tokyo-based Popin, which also serves clients in Japan and Taiwan.

Lee said Dable proves the competitiveness of its products by running A/B tests to compare the performance of competitors against Dables recommendations and see which one results in the most clickthroughs. It also does A/B testing to compare the performance of articles picked by editors against ones that were recommended by Dables algorithms.

Dable also provides algorithms that allow clients more flexibility in what kind of personalized content they display, which is a selling point as media companies try to recover from the massive drop in ad spending precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, Dables Related Articles algorithm is based on content that visitors have already viewed, while its Perused Article algorithm gauges how interested visitors are in certain articles based on metrics like how much time they spent reading them. It also has another algorithm that displays the most viewed articles based on gender and age groups.","Content discovery platform Dable closes $12 million Series C at $90 million valuation to accelerate its global expansion Launched in South Korea five years ago, content discovery platform Dable now serves a total of six markets in Asia.

Acacia, whose backers include Summit Partners, Commonwealth Capital Ventures and Matrix Partners, is only the second tech IPO of the year. The other one, from Dell spinoff SecureWorks (NASDAQ:SCWX), priced below its targets, plunged below its offering price and stayed there ever since.","Acacia, on the other hand, raised $104 million by offering 4.5 million shares at $23, the high end of its target range of between $21 and $23.

Its stock jumped by more than 30 percent above it IPO price in early trading, hitting as high as $30.56.

Acacia (NASDAQ:ACIA) is the seventh IPO from Massachusetts this year,  according to the Boston Business Journal, with all of the rest coming from the biotech and life sciences sectors.

In comparison, the nation's largest tech center — the San Francisco Bay Area — has had only one IPO this year and its last tech offering came in early December when Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) went public at $21 a share. That one has has managed to stay above its offering price after coming out of the gates with a healthy jump, closing Friday at $21.93.

Bloomberg's Silicon Valley Tech Index is down by about 13 percent in the past year when IPOs dropped dramatically in the region.

A survey  released this week of tech dealmakers by the law firm of Morrison & Foerster showed that public market volatility is contributing heavily to pessimism that IPOs will pick up this year. About 58 percent forecast a continued decline in the number of new public offerings.

But if Acacia can hold onto its strong debut momentum it could show that public investors have some appetite for new tech offerings.

""Friendship is more than just the things you chat about,"" said Will Wu, the director of product at Snapchat as he unveiled Snap Games at a Partner Summit in Los Angeles to highlight the new features for creators and app developers.","""Friendship is also about experience you have together.""

The six made-for-Snapchat games, including ""Bitmoji Party,"" ""Alphabear Hustle"" and ""Zombie Rescue Squad,"" will be part of a global gaming industry that saw $77 billion in revenue last year, Wu said.

""We wanted to build something that makes us feel like we're playing a board game with family over a long holiday weekend, something that makes us feel like we're sitting with friends, controllers in hand,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, these games are hard to find on mobile (...) it's hard to get everybody to install the same game, and it's hard to chat.""

The six games will be directly accessible from Snapchat's popular messaging feature Chat, offering users the possibility to play while at the same time exchanging messages.

""Bitmoji Party,"" developed by Snapchat parent Snap and inspired by Nintendo's ""Wii Party,"" for example features players, brought to life with 3D Bitmojis, as they compete across four fast-paced mini-games.

""You can launch Bitmoji Party right from the chat bar, allowing you and your friends to instantly play together, no install required,"" Wu said.

""Alphabear Hustle"" is described as a fast-paced word game in which players work together to spell words, collect cute bears and build their own personal bear village.

""Zombie Rescue Squad"" deals with a zombie apocalypse that calls on players to ""rescue survivors from the hungry hordes and gather as many supplies as you can.

""But if you miss the helicopter to safety, you'll be left behind!""

Outside developer partners of these games will be able to earn money through video advertising.

In a bid to enrich its content and widen its network, Snapchat also announced it was partnering with outside developers that will be able to integrate Snapchat features into their apps.

For example, Fitbit smartwatch users will be able to access Bitmojis and a Netflix subscriber will be able to directly publish a message on Snapchat about a favourite series. Users of mobile dating app Tinder for their part will be able to publish their Snapchat ""story"" on their profile.

Snapchat said it also plans to expand on its new original series for the messaging app that were launched in October.

The shows, which run three to five minutes each, are designed for Snapchat and are shot in vertical form for smartphone viewing. They include graphics and split screens.

""We're navigating a profound transformation in storytelling,"" said Sean Mills, the head of original content at Snap. ""Mobile is now the dominant medium for telling stories and consuming.

""In 2019, mobile will surpass television in time spent for US adults.""

The series explore various issues, including teen love, race relations or sports.

Snapchat has nearly 190 million daily active users but has struggled to boost revenue from young users. It has lost money every year since it was launched in 2011 and has even said it may never turn a profit.

In the United States, Snapchat reaches nearly 75 percent of people between the ages of 13 and 34, and 90 percent of those between the ages of 13 and 24, said Evan Spiegel, the head of Snapchat.

""In fact, we reach more 13-24 year-olds than Facebook or Instagram in the United States, the UK, France, Canada and Australia,"" he added.

The folks at BuzzFeed seem to understand that.","A job listing for Support Specialist at BuzzFeed takes an unorthodox approach at vetting potential candidates.

To apply, BuzzFeed asks applicants:

Instead of a cover letter, please send us instructions on how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Text, images, video … the format for your PB&J tutorial is up to you, as long following your instructions results in a really delicious sandwich.

“One of the main responsibilities for the Support Specialist will be creating documentation and FAQs for our editing tools,” Alice DuBois, BuzzFeed product Lead for Editorial Tools, said in an email to Metro. “We're interested in getting a sense of applicants'' communication style. So instead of a cover letter, which tend to be generic and forgettable, we're asking people to demonstrate a skill they'll have to use in the job.”

Applicants will still have to submit resumes and interview for the positions, though Chris Johanesen, BuzzFeed VP of Product, had the idea to conduct one of the interviews over GChat, since the support specialist will spend a lot of time helping people via instant messages.

“Many tweets about this job posting seem to suggest that BuzzFeed has decided to request PB&J instructions instead of a cover letter for all of our job postings, so I want to point out that we made this request only for the Support Specialist position,” DuBois said.

In addition to amazing sandwich making skills, candidates must possess amazing communication skills, problem solving skills and of course a sense of humor.

(Mount Kisco, NY); Reznicek, Alexander (Troy, NY); Rim, Kern (San Diego, CA), filed on August 22, 2016, was published online on September 12, 2017.

The assignee for this patent, patent number 9761610, is International Business Machines Corporation (Armonk, NY).","Reporters obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: ""The present invention relates generally to semiconductor devices, and more particularly to utilizing strained silicon-on-insulator (SSOI) substrates for nFET regions with strain release in pFET regions.

""A complementary metal oxide semiconductor device (CMOS) uses complementary and symmetrically-oriented pairs of p-type and n-type metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) arranged on silicon or silicon on insulator (SOI) substrates. A MOSFET, which is used for amplifying or switching electronic signals for logic functions, has source and drain regions connected by a channel. The source region is a terminal through which current in the form of majority charge carriers electrons or holes) enters the channel, and the drain region is a terminal through which current in the form of majority charge carriers leaves the channel. In a p-type MOSFET (hereinafter 'pFET'), the majority charge carriers are holes that flow through the channel, and in an n-type MOSFET (hereinafter 'nFET'), the majority charge carriers are electrons that flow through the channel. A gate overlies the channel and controls the flow of current between the source and drain regions. The channel may be defined by a thin 'fin' that provides more than one surface through which the gate controls the flow of current, thereby making the pFETs and nFETs 'finFET' devices. Generally, the length of the fin is several orders of magnitude greater than the width.

""Substrates used in the fabrication of pFETs and nFETs may comprise strained silicon on insulator (SSOI) substrates. Such substrates generally have intrinsic tensile stresses of several giga-Pascals (GPa), which generally improves electron mobility, thereby improving device performance. The strain in these substrates allows for improvement in device performance without a degradation in electrostatic characteristics even in short-channel finFET devices where the length and the width of the channel is short compared to those of typical planar MOSFETs.

""When the global intrinsic stresses in an SSOI substrate exceed a predetermined maximum value (e.g., greater than about 1 GPa), however, the performance of pFET finFET devices may be compromised by 8 to 15%. This is a consequence of hole mobility degradation in the presence of tensile stress in the SSOI substrates. Accordingly, it is desirable to relax the tensile stress in the channels of pFET devices and to improve/restore their performance to the SOI substrate levels. If this can be achieved, nFET devices can be produced having higher performance without degrading the complementary pFET devices.""

374,HOU0000020200714eg7b0000b,Tech firm Rackspace files for IPO again,"Rackspace Technology, the San Antonio tech firm, is heading back to the stock market.

The cloud service company on Friday filed for an initial public offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Rackspace is looking to list its common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol ""RXT."" Its registration statement, however, didn't include the number of shares the company intends to sell off.

Founded in San Antonio in 1998, the company has been in private hands for four years.

Apollo Global Management Inc., a New York-based private equity firm, acquired Rackspace in 2016 in a deal valued at $4.3 billion. Apollo paid $32 a share in taking the company private. Rackspace shares previously traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

As a private company, Rackspace has posted a string of annual losses.

In its initial public offering filing, it reported losses of $59.9 million in 2017, $470.6 million in 2018 and $102.3 million last year - on revenue of $2.1 billion, $2.45 billion and $2.44 billion, respectively.

""Over the past eight years, we have invested over $1 billion and 12 million hours to develop a robust and proprietary suite of over 200 technology tools, branded solutions and accelerators for our customers,"" company officials said in the filing.

One analyst said the firm's annual losses aren't a major cause for concern. But the company will need to show improved results soon after its IPO, said Philbert Shih, managing director of Structure Research, a Toronto consulting firm that analyzes the internet infrastructure market.

""When it comes to infrastructure companies that have cycles, you have to invest heavily to support and expand growth. There's a lot of operational expenses (and) capital expenditure involved, so they've gone through that,"" Shih said. ""If you describe them going private as kind of a retrenching and investment phase, well, that phase is over, and now they're going to have to perform.""

.

Rackspace, with a workforce of about 6,800, started out as a company that hosted websites. But as bigger players such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft have taken over that market, Rackspace in recent years has shifted to cloud management. Cloud computing lets businesses access and store their data online.

The company went public in 2008 with an IPO that raised $187.5 million. Rackspace shares opened at $12.50 a share, and climbed to about $80 in 2013. But by mid-2016, its stock had fallen about 60 percent from its peak.

In its filing Friday, the firm said it hadn't been ""significantly impacted"" by the COVID-19 pandemic - most of its employees have been working from home, and the company's services are delivered remotely. But a prolonged pandemic could ""have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows,"" officials said.

""If the pandemic or the resulting economic downturn continues to worsen, we could experience service disruption, loss of customers or higher levels of doubtful trade accounts receivable,"" they said.

Shih said the pandemic and ensuing shift to remote working have been a boon for Rackspace's business, with employers increasingly relying on the cloud.

""There's certain infrastructure that's very critical and continues to run amid the pandemic, and, in fact, people are moving more stuff online and that benefits Rackspace,"" Shih said.

From March through May, just nine companies filed for IPOs in the United States compared to 46 over the same three months in 2019, according to data provider IPO Boutique.

IPO activity, however, is beginning to rebound. Twenty-four companies went public last month, up from 20 IPOs in June 2019

12,PNN0000020140717ea7h0000j,ADwin DAQ Systems Support New Visualization Software,"Kalliste' Development Software Is Designed for Test Engineers

CHESTERLAND OH — CAS DataLoggers and Jager are proud to announce that ADwin data acquisition systems are now supporting new visualization software. Kalliste' is a fully-intuitive visualization software package for test and R&D data acquisition applications. Kalliste' is unique because it has no icons or programming languages, so it's easy to learn which substantially cuts development time. Additionally, Kalliste' will soon be packaged with ADwin devices, enabling users to perform quick data visualization such as charts and graphs.","Specifically designed for test engineers, Kallisté is an object-oriented application development software which has access to ADwin hardware right from the start. It covers users' needs for data acquisition, test bench supervision, telemetry, after-flight data extraction, after-test data analysis and test reports.

Kallisté is a fully-programmable data acquisition software supporting major devices including:

• Instruments through VISA or IVI drivers,

• Data acquisition boards through vendors' drivers,

• Real time process control through real time CPU-controlled hosted data acquisition,

• Acquisition through digital buses like ARINC-429, MIL-STD-1553, Ethernet, CAN,

• Acquisition of data streams through IRIG standards,

• Telemetry streams through its MAGALI interface.

Kallisté is a programming environment embedding the three major components of such software:

• An Integrated editor to create applications,

• A Symbolic debugger,

• An Independent runtime engine.

Kallisté is object-based:

• Users can extend its available resources in many ways,

• The system is fully polymorphic (users don't have to deal with data types and shapes),

• Fully event-driven (no algorithms required to manage the application),

• Natively fully-multithreaded without intervention from the user.

Kallisté is designed for maximum portability:

• Kallisté supports all typically-used operating systems,

• Kallisté creates auto-installable applications,

• Kallisté includes a development toolkit to enlarge the object range.

Kallisté is more than just data acquisition software:

• Kallisté embeds objects for data analysis, data conversion and exchanges,

• Kallisté is able to create user interfaces independent from the hardware,

• Kallisté can be embedded for flight test.

With Kalliste' you don't have to learn any programming or macro language—just English! You can design your own application just by using English sentences and simple Drag and Drop operations. Kalliste' is not only smart and programmable but also easy to use--more than 99% of the code is written by the system. Creating a measurement application from scratch with Kallisté is easy using the complete WYSIWYG display editor. Applications can run under WINDOWS, LINUX, UNIX, MAC OS, and ANDROID.

ADwin data acquisition and control systems are high-performance real time systems capable of parallel, individually-controlled processes. These systems can run independently of a PC's operating system to provide deterministic operation with response times of 1 usec. or less. ADwin systems see common use in electrical component testing, sensors and ECU's, control of servohydraulic systems, testing automotive components, motion control, synchronized data acquisition, and many other demanding applications.

The key feature of an ADwin system is its TICO co-processor, which has been optimized for fast reaction and exact timing in a nanosecond time scale. The TiCo processor runs independently as a programmable co-processor which has access to all inputs and outputs and fulfills special tasks such as filtering, data conversion, communication (SPI), signal generation, control, and more. The TiCo processor can support the ADwin CPU's task, for example by preprocessing, or it can undertake a complete task on its own.

Each ADwin system has a central processing unit, the ADwin CPU, which executes all time-critical tasks in real time. These systems have tightly-coupled analog and digital inputs/outputs along with add-ons like counters and bus interfaces which form the connection to the test stand, allowing for extremely low-latency operation.

The user-friendly ADwin software environment can be used under Windows (95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP/Windows 7) and LINUX or as a reliable stand-alone data acquisition system. ADwin also has drivers for many typical programming environments including VB, VC/C++, LabVIEW, TestPoint and others.

5,ELECWK0020140117ea1m001b3,QUALCOMM Incorporated; Patent Issued for Responding to an Interactive Multicast Message within a Wireless Communication System,"2014 JAN 22 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Electronics Newsweekly -- From Alexandria, Virginia, VerticalNews journalists report that a patent by the inventor Song, Bongyong (San Diego, CA), filed on September 17, 2008, was published online on January 7, 2014.

The patent's assignee for patent number 8625475 is QUALCOMM Incorporated (San Diego, CA).","News editors obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: ""The invention relates to communications in a wireless telecommunication system and, more particularly to methods of responding to an interactive multicast message within the wireless communication system.

""Wireless communication systems have developed through various generations, including a first-generation analog wireless phone service (1G), a second-generation (2G) digital wireless phone service (including interim 2.5G and 2.75G networks) and a third-generation (3G) high speed data/Internet-capable wireless service. There are presently many different types of wireless communication systems in use, including Cellular and Personal Communications Service (PCS) systems. Examples of known cellular systems include the cellular Analog Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS), and digital cellular systems based on Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), the Global System for Mobile access (GSM) variation of TDMA, and newer hybrid digital communication systems using both TDMA and CDMA technologies.

""The method for providing CDMA mobile communications was standardized in the United States by the Telecommunications Industry Association/Electronic Industries Association in TIA/EIA/IS-95-A entitled 'Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System,' referred to herein as IS-95. Combined AMPS & CDMA systems are described in TIA/EIA Standard IS-98. Other communications systems are described in the IMT-2000/UM, or International Mobile Telecommunications System 2000/Universal Mobile Telecommunications System, standards covering what are referred to as wideband CDMA (WCDMA), CDMA2000 (such as CDMA2000 1.times.EV-DO standards, for example) or TD-SCDMA.

""In wireless communication systems, mobile stations, handsets, or access terminals (AT) receive signals from fixed position base stations (also referred to as cell sites or cells) that support communication links or service within particular geographic regions adjacent to or surrounding the base stations. Base stations provide entry points to an access network (AN)/radio access network (RAN), which is generally a packet data network using standard Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) based protocols that support methods for differentiating traffic based on Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Therefore, the base stations generally interact with ATs through an over the air interface and with the AN through Internet Protocol (IP) network data packets.

""In wireless telecommunication systems, Push-to-talk (PTT) capabilities are becoming popular with service sectors and consumers. PTT can support a 'dispatch' voice service that operates over standard commercial wireless infrastructures, such as CDMA, FDMA, TDMA, GSM, etc. In a dispatch model, communication between endpoints (ATs) occurs within virtual groups, wherein the voice of one 'talker' is transmitted to one or more 'listeners.' A single instance of this type of communication is commonly referred to as a dispatch call, or simply a PTT call. A PTT call is an instantiation of a group, which defines the characteristics of a call. A group in essence is defined by a member list and associated information, such as group name or group identification.

""Conventionally, data packets within a wireless communication network have been configured to be sent to a single destination or access terminal. A transmission of data to a single destination is referred to as 'unicast'. As mobile communications have increased, the ability to transmit given data concurrently to multiple access terminals has become more important. Accordingly, protocols have been adopted to support concurrent data transmissions of the same packet or message to multiple destinations or target access terminals. A 'broadcast' refers to a transmission of data packets to all destinations or access terminals (e.g., within a given cell, served by a given service provider, etc.), while a 'multicast' refers to a transmission of data packets to a given group of destinations or access terminals. In an example, the given group of destinations or 'multicast group' may include more than one and less than all of possible destinations or access terminals (e.g., within a given group, served by a given service provider, etc.). However, it is at least possible in certain situations that the multicast group comprises only one access terminal, similar to a unicast, or alternatively that the multicast group comprises all access terminals (e.g., within a given cell, etc.), similar to a broadcast.

""Broadcasts and/or multicasts may be performed within wireless communication systems in a number of ways, such as performing a plurality of sequential unicast operations to accommodate the multicast group, allocating a unique broadcast/multicast channel (BCH) for handling multiple data transmissions at the same time and the like. A conventional system using a broadcast channel for push-to-talk communications is described in United States Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0049314 dated Mar. 1, 2007 and entitled 'Push-To-Talk Group Call System Using CDMA 1x-EVDO Cellular Network', the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As described in Publication No. 2007/0049314, a broadcast channel can be used for push-to-talk calls using conventional signaling techniques. Although the use of a broadcast channel may improve bandwidth requirements over conventional unicast techniques, the conventional signaling of the broadcast channel can still result in additional overhead and/or delay and may degrade system performance.

""The 3.sup.rd Generation Partnership Project 2 ('3GPP2') defines a broadcast-multicast service (BCMCS) specification for supporting multicast communications in CDMA2000 networks. Accordingly, a version of 3GPP2's BCMCS specification, entitled 'CDMA2000 High Rate Broadcast-Multicast Packet Data Air Interface Specification', dated Feb. 14, 2006, Version 1.0 C.S0054-A, is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.""

As a supplement to the background information on this patent, VerticalNews correspondents also obtained the inventor's summary information for this patent: ""Embodiments of the present invention are directed to wireless communication systems and methods of scheduling access terminal responses to an interactive multicast message are provided. A radio access network (RAN) generates an access control message (ACM), the ACM indicating feedback instructions for a plurality of access terminals (ATs) belonging to a given multicast group. The feedback instructions of the ACM designate a temporary manner in which the plurality of access terminals are to respond to an interactive multicast message. The target ATs receive the interactive multicast message as well as the ACM. The target ATs, or multicast group members, respond to the interactive multicast message based on the feedback instructions for the plurality of access terminals indicated by the ACM.""

""The method for providing CDMA mobile communications was standardized in the United States by the Telecommunications Industry Association/Electronic Industries Association in TIA/EIA/IS-95-A entitled 'Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System,' referred to herein as IS-95. Combined AMPS & CDMA systems are described in TIA/EIA Standard IS-98. Other communications systems are described in the IMT-2000/UM, or International Mobile Telecommunications System 2000/Universal Mobile Telecommunications System, standards covering what are referred to as wideband CDMA (WCDMA), CDMA2000 (such as CDMA2000 1.times.EV-DO standards, for example) or TD-SCDMA.

""In wireless communication systems, mobile stations, handsets, or access terminals (AT) receive signals from fixed position base stations (also referred to as cell sites or cells) that support communication links or service within particular geographic regions adjacent to or surrounding the base stations. Base stations provide entry points to an access network (AN)/radio access network (RAN), which is generally a packet data network using standard Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) based protocols that support methods for differentiating traffic based on Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Therefore, the base stations generally interact with ATs through an over the air interface and with the AN through Internet Protocol (IP) network data packets.

""In wireless telecommunication systems, Push-to-talk (PTT) capabilities are becoming popular with service sectors and consumers. PTT can support a 'dispatch' voice service that operates over standard commercial wireless infrastructures, such as CDMA, FDMA, TDMA, GSM, etc. In a dispatch model, communication between endpoints (ATs) occurs within virtual groups, wherein the voice of one 'talker' is transmitted to one or more 'listeners.' A single instance of this type of communication is commonly referred to as a dispatch call, or simply a PTT call. A PTT call is an instantiation of a group, which defines the characteristics of a call. A group in essence is defined by a member list and associated information, such as group name or group identification.

""Conventionally, data packets within a wireless communication network have been configured to be sent to a single destination or access terminal. A transmission of data to a single destination is referred to as 'unicast'. As mobile communications have increased, the ability to transmit given data concurrently to multiple access terminals has become more important. Accordingly, protocols have been adopted to support concurrent data transmissions of the same packet or message to multiple destinations or target access terminals. A 'broadcast' refers to a transmission of data packets to all destinations or access terminals (e.g., within a given cell, served by a given service provider, etc.), while a 'multicast' refers to a transmission of data packets to a given group of destinations or access terminals. In an example, the given group of destinations or 'multicast group' may include more than one and less than all of possible destinations or access terminals (e.g., within a given group, served by a given service provider, etc.). However, it is at least possible in certain situations that the multicast group comprises only one access terminal, similar to a unicast, or alternatively that the multicast group comprises all access terminals (e.g., within a given cell, etc.), similar to a broadcast.

""Broadcasts and/or multicasts may be performed within wireless communication systems in a number of ways, such as performing a plurality of sequential unicast operations to accommodate the multicast group, allocating a unique broadcast/multicast channel (BCH) for handling multiple data transmissions at the same time and the like. A conventional system using a broadcast channel for push-to-talk communications is described in United States Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0049314 dated Mar. 1, 2007 and entitled 'Push-To-Talk Group Call System Using CDMA 1x-EVDO Cellular Network', the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As described in Publication No. 2007/0049314, a broadcast channel can be used for push-to-talk calls using conventional signaling techniques. Although the use of a broadcast channel may improve bandwidth requirements over conventional unicast techniques, the conventional signaling of the broadcast channel can still result in additional overhead and/or delay and may degrade system performance.

""The 3.sup.rd Generation Partnership Project 2 ('3GPP2') defines a broadcast-multicast service (BCMCS) specification for supporting multicast communications in CDMA2000 networks. Accordingly, a version of 3GPP2's BCMCS specification, entitled 'CDMA2000 High Rate Broadcast-Multicast Packet Data Air Interface Specification', dated Feb. 14, 2006, Version 1.0 C.S0054-A, is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.""

As a supplement to the background information on this patent, VerticalNews correspondents also obtained the inventor's summary information for this patent: ""Embodiments of the present invention are directed to wireless communication systems and methods of scheduling access terminal responses to an interactive multicast message are provided. A radio access network (RAN) generates an access control message (ACM), the ACM indicating feedback instructions for a plurality of access terminals (ATs) belonging to a given multicast group. The feedback instructions of the ACM designate a temporary manner in which the plurality of access terminals are to respond to an interactive multicast message. The target ATs receive the interactive multicast message as well as the ACM. The target ATs, or multicast group members, respond to the interactive multicast message based on the feedback instructions for the plurality of access terminals indicated by the ACM.""

342,COMWKN0020140221ea2r00054,"Fusion-io; Fusion-io Optimizes Virtualization with Flexible Flash Solutions to Accelerate VDI, Virtual Machines and Hybrid Flash Appliances","2014 FEB 27 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Computer Weekly News -- [VMware Partner Exchange trade show booth 409] - Fusion-io (NYSE: FIO) announced comprehensive updates to its full portfolio of flash-fueled virtualization solutions based on Fusion ioMemory. In addition to this week's announcement of the general availability of Fusion ioVDI software for virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) acceleration, Fusion-io has also introduced updates to the Fusion ioTurbine virtualization caching software, a new VMware Reference Architecture for the Fusion ioControl hybrid flash array, and certification support for the VMware Virtual SAN.","""Flash and virtualization technologies complement each other to maximize datacenter efficiency, performance, and cost savings,"" said Lee Caswell, Fusion-io vice president, Virtualization Products Group. ""By relieving the stress that virtualization places on conventional disk performance as users increase virtual server density, flash memory extends the performance of desktops and boosts the value of existing shared storage resources.""

Fusion-io customers have reported performance gains of nearly 20x with flash-optimized acceleration for data-intensive virtualization workloads. With a full portfolio of server and desktop virtualization acceleration solutions, Fusion-io offers flash solutions that maximize the efficiency of virtualization with flash that fits across a wide variety of existing datacenter architectures.

This week's general availability introduction of Fusion ioVDI, the industry's first desktop-aware VDI solution, finally makes it possible to support persistent virtual desktops while maximizing performance and minimizing both capital and operating expenses. Fusion ioVDI software leverages Fusion ioMemory flash to deliver seamless, reliable, and cost-effective virtual desktop performance with consistent low latency response times for even data-intensive application workloads.

A new VMware-validated VDI Reference Architecture with VMware Horizon View documents how companies implementing VDI can lower storage costs per desktop while delivering the predictable user experience necessary for VDI success with the Fusion ioControl hybrid flash appliance. With the unique, software-defined ability to assign performance according to application priorities, ioControl simplifies performance management while ensuring that the right applications get the right performance at the right time. The new Reference Architecture provides guidelines on maximizing consistent performance and reducing VDI implementation risks with ioControl Hybrid Storage, Cisco UCS and VMware Horizon View.

To maximize server-side flash economics within SAN-enabled datacenters, a newly released update for Fusion ioTurbine caching software now provides tighter integration with vCenter as well as new operating system support for vSphere 5.5, RHEL 6.5 and SLES 11. Fusion ioTurbine offloads SANs by up to 96 percent with support for hypervisor and guest caching, dynamic reallocation of cache memory during vMotion, and unified management of caching across virtual and physical environments. To evaluate actual application workloads to assess the benefits of caching in their unique datacenter environments, IT professionals can download the ioTurbine Profiler software after a quick registration. Enterprises can also receive complimentary performance evaluation consultations through the Fusion-io Fast Flash program.

""Companies of all sizes have adopted virtualization to make better use of IT resources and achieve economic savings,"" said David Floyer, Wikibon Chief Technology Officer. ""However, virtualization brings an IO 'tax' that can adversely affect performance and user experience, especially with latency sensitive workloads such as database and VDI. Fusion-io provides a rich variety of storage products and software that easily integrate into the datacenter, enabling databases, virtual servers, VDI, and high performance applications to deliver cost-effective performance in virtual environments.""

In addition, Fusion ioMemory flash products are now VMware-certified as optimized solutions for powerful flash performance for the VMware Virtual SAN converged virtual infrastructure. Currently in public testing, VMware Virtual SAN is a new software-defined storage solution that extends the hypervisor to pool CPUs, flash memory and locally attached disks to provide a converged compute and storage infrastructure. Trusted by thousands of enterprises around the world, the unique architecture of Fusion-io flash memory maximizes performance in VMware Virtual SAN deployments.

""We are pleased to work with Fusion-io to provide our customers with solutions that enable simplicity and provide cost-effective performance,"" said Sanjay Katyal, vice president, VMware Global Strategic Alliances Organization. ""From servers to shared flash appliances, Fusion-io provides performance for virtualized environments to accelerate business success with VMware solutions.""

But earlier this month in rolling out the third plank of his education platform, he proposed doing even worse — spending more money on something we know doesn't work: K12 Inc., the country's largest online education company. We hold schools, students, and soon teachers accountable. It's time to hold purveyors of failure accountable as well.","Founded in 2000 with funding from convicted Wall Street felon Michael Milken, K12 Inc. has a great business model. Virtual schools cut out the expensive brick & mortar facilities and move the entire school online where students can point and click their way to a high school diploma. No schoolhouse means no light bill, no cafeteria, no janitors, and no gym teacher. Their overhead is a fraction of a neighborhood public school, but thanks to a loophole snuck into the same 2011 bill that cut funding for Texas public schools by $5.4 billion, virtual schools get funded at the same level.

K12 Inc. might be great for its investors, but it's horrible for its students. Everywhere virtual schools have been tried they have failed to meet minimum standards or do better than public schools, according to a report by Progress Texas. K12 Inc. is so ineffective that the NCAA announced last month that it was K12 Inc. credits would no longer count towards eligibility.

The problem with running schools like a business is that Wall Street is usually the model. Last year, the company paid $6.75 million to settle a class-action securities lawsuit that alleged K12 Inc. lied to investors about academic performance, enrollment figures, and student retention. The Florida Department of Education investigated allegations that K12 Inc. asked employees to cover up its use of uncertified teachers, and then the Securities and Exchange Commission investigated K12 Inc. when the company failed to disclose the Florida probe to investors.

Because of these problems, former TEA Commissioner Robert Scott kept K12 Inc.'s enrollment caps low, but after he announced his resignation on May 1, 2012 TEA staff interpreted a new state law as lifting enrollment caps for virtual schools. Perhaps anticipating Scott's refusal to adopt the rule, TEA staff did not present this finding to the Commissioner until Gov. Rick Perry appointed Williams that August.

Soon after, Williams issued a rule that essentially deregulated online virtual schools. According to an agency spokeswoman, the new rule ""eliminate[d] the requirement for application to the agency to operate full-time online schools and eliminate enrollment caps."" Hindsight might be 20/20, but Williams' decision to open the state treasury to a company with such a lousy track record both in the classroom and in the boardroom still doesn't make sense.

Perhaps coincidentally, about two week before Perry announced Williams as his new education chief, Williams attended Andrea McWilliams' 40th birthday party at a Sonoma winery, an event so lavish it made the society pages. McWilliams is also a lobbyist for K12 Inc. In political circles, her birthday party weekend in wine country is best remembered for not being disclosed on her ethics filing as required by state law because a handful of state lawmakers attended, including Sen. Dan Patrick and Rep. Jim Pitts, then the chairman of appropriations.

Williams, who did not disclose receiving any gifts from lobbyists on his financial disclosure form, seemed to enjoy the party where guests received gift bags according to a published report. The party also featured a surprise appearance by rapper Ton Loc, prompting Williams to tweet, ""Ton Loc makes surprise visit to Andrea McWilliams' birthday party. Crowd goes wild over wild thing.""

Even after restoring some of the 2011 cuts to public schools, education funding continues to lag behind population growth in Texas, so it is a cruel exception of generosity that Abbott, the gubernatorial frontrunner, likes virtual schools. If we truly wanted to run schools like a business, it is doubtful we would invest in a proven failure, no matter who their friends were.

22,COMWKN0020190613ef6d000g8,Computers - Computer-Aided Design; Reports Outline Computer-Aided Design Study Results from University of Florida (Security-aware Fsm Design Flow for Identifying and Mitigating Vulnerabilities To Fault Attacks),"2019 JUN 19 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Computer Weekly News -- Fresh data on Computers - Computer-Aided Design are presented in a new report. According to news originating from Gainesville, United States, by VerticalNews correspondents, research stated, ""The security of a system-on-chip (SoC) can be compromised by exploiting the vulnerabilities of the finite state machines (FSMs) in the SoC controller modules through fault injection attacks. These vulnerabilities may be unintentionally introduced by traditional FSM design practices or by CAD tools during synthesis.""

Financial supporters for this research include Semiconductor Research Corporation, Cisco Systems, Inc., NSF.","Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of Florida, ""In this paper, we first analyze how the vulnerabilities in an FSM can be exploited by fault injection attacks. Then, we propose a security-aware FSM design flow for ASIC designs to mitigate them and prevent fault attacks on FSM. Our proposed FSM design flow starts with a security-aware encoding scheme which makes the FSM resilient against fault attacks. However, the vulnerabilities introduced by the CAD tools cannot be addressed by encoding schemes alone. To analyze for such vulnerabilities, we develop a novel technique named analyzing vulnerabilities in FSM. If any vulnerability exists, we propose a secure FSM architecture to address the issue.

Our reports deliver fact-based news of research and discoveries from around the world. Copyright 2019, NewsRx LLC","Computers - Computer-Aided Design; Reports Outline Computer-Aided Design Study Results from University of Florida (Security-aware Fsm Design Flow for Identifying and Mitigating Vulnerabilities To Fault Attacks) 2019 JUN 19 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Computer Weekly News -- Fresh data on Computers - Computer-Aided Design are presented in a new report. According to news originating from Gainesville, United States, by VerticalNews correspondents, research stated, ""The security of a system-on-chip (SoC) can be compromised by exploiting the vulnerabilities of the finite state machines (FSMs) in the SoC controller modules through fault injection attacks. These vulnerabilities may be unintentionally introduced by traditional FSM design practices or by CAD tools during synthesis.""

Financial supporters for this research include Semiconductor Research Corporation, Cisco Systems, Inc., NSF. Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of Florida, ""In this paper, we first analyze how the vulnerabilities in an FSM can be exploited by fault injection attacks. Then, we propose a security-aware FSM design flow for ASIC designs to mitigate them and prevent fault attacks on FSM. Our proposed FSM design flow starts with a security-aware encoding scheme which makes the FSM resilient against fault attacks. However, the vulnerabilities introduced by the CAD tools cannot be addressed by encoding schemes alone. To analyze for such vulnerabilities, we develop a novel technique named analyzing vulnerabilities in FSM. If any vulnerability exists, we propose a secure FSM architecture to address the issue. In this paper, we mainly focus on setup-time violation-based fault attacks which pose a serious threat on FSMs; though our proposed flow works for advanced laser-based fault attacks as well. We compare our proposed secure FSM design flow with traditional FSM design practices in terms of cost, performance, and security.""

140,LAWTON0020140112ea1b0002a,"Microsoft, Sony announce sales figures, improvements","The Consumer Electronics Show provided gamers with several surprises this week.

Both Microsoft and Sony announced sales figures for their respective next-generation consoles through the end of 2013. Both systems were primarily sold out through the majority of the holiday shopping season, but Sony still held the edge in overall worldwide sales. Microsoft touted more than 3 million Xbox One consoles had been sold since its Nov. 22 launch, again stressing the strange title of ""fastest-selling console ever."" Sony waited until its keynote speech Tuesday to announce 4.4 million PlayStation 4 consoles were sold since its Nov. 15 launch. Both are still hard to find in stores, so it seems demand has yet to be sated, which spells good news for both manufacturers.","The latest sales figures put the PS4 ahead of the Nintendo Wii U's latest 3.91 million total. To give a bit of perspective, the Wii U launched a full year earlier and has already been surpassed by a console on the market for less than two months. It appears the Xbox One will surpass it soon, possibly before the end of March, if sales continue on this trend. Both consoles are well beyond their predecessors at this point. An estimated 1.7 million PlayStation 3 consoles were sold in the same period in 2006 and an estimated 1.5 million Xbox 360 units were sold in the same period in 2005.

After getting their numbers out of the way, Sony continued gaining momentum with the announcement of the PlayStation Now streaming service. Andrew House, president of Sony Computer Entertainment Inc., let the cat out of the bag during the keynote speech, setting the stage for a very interesting early 2014. PlayStation Now will be Sony's answer to Netflix. Not only will it stream video games, but also music and movies, to just about every electronic device imaginable. Set to launch at some point this summer, probably after the Electronic Entertainment Expo in June, the service will allow gamers to rent or purchase their favorite classic games and play them on their PS4 consoles, computers, tablets or even Sony Bravia smart televisions. No pricing or technical details were announced during the unveiling, but CES reports suggest an Internet connection of at least 5Mbps will be required. This service was predicted for some time after Sony purchased the streaming service Gaikai in 2012 for $380 million.

Online game streaming is nothing new. OnLive was one of the first companies to push the idea, which could allow anyone with a computer and broadband Internet connection to play games that wouldn't otherwise be playable on their systems. The game's video rendering, physics, artificial intelligence and processes are all handled by a service, which transmits everything over the Internet to the player. The problem players ran into was input lag. Due to basic physics, there is a delay from when the data is sent and when it's received by both the server and the player - resulting in the possibility of a slight delay from a player's actions and what's seen on screen. While this might not be much of an issue for slower-paced games, such as turnbased strategy titles or RPGs, it can become quite the issue for shooters and character action games, which require quick reflexes and sharp control. Sony's game of the year, ""The Last of Us,"" was one of the titles on display being played on the PS4 and various tablets. The visuals were sharp and input lag was kept to a minimum, but that could be because the servers were literally down the hall from the demo area.

Microsoft is rumored to be working on a similar service. After OnLive went out of business, Microsoft swooped in and purchased the infrastructure. Microsoft has not officially announced anything, but reports are pointing to a possible unveiling of a streaming service of its own at E3. It wouldn't be surprising, as Microsoft is trying to keep feature parity with the PS4, even though the Xbox One is severely underpowered.

Another feature Microsoft is still behind in the curve on is online content sharing. Announced at its own E3 conference before Sony had the chance to, the Xbox One was going to be able to broadcast live streams of players engaging in various games in a systemwide feature on Twitch. Sony followed up the announcement with one of its own, with the PS4 supporting both Twitch and Ustream. Microsoft delayed the feature and still hasn't given any indication when it might be added to the system. When questioned at CES, Microsoft and Twitch both answered with a vague ""few more months"" window.
