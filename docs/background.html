<h2>Traditional Methods to Measure Innovation</h2>
<p>We can broadly define “business innovation” as the process of creating new or improved changes in business. Following the international guidelines for surveys of business innovation in the OSLO Manual, developed by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and Eurostat, any business innovation can be categorized either as a: product innovation, business process innovation, marketing innovation, or organizational innovation. A product innovation, most commonly the innovation discussed within text sources, implies the introduction of a new or improved product to the market. Business innovation is crucial for value creation which can be achieved by the introduction of new or improved products in the market. As a key indicator of growth in the economy, accurately gauging the extent of business innovation is of crucial importance for policymakers.</p>
<p>Traditional efforts to measure innovation in the United States primarily include the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) division the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/srvyberd/">Business R&amp;D and Innovation Survey (BRDIS)</a> and the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/srvyabs/">Annual Business Survey (ABS)</a>. The surveys aim to capture the state of innovation in the United States through a nationally representative sample of non-farm businesses across the country that asks if businesses have innovated in the past year, as defined by the 2018 Oslo Manual — any new or improved product available on the market. However, additional methods of measuring innovation can help provide further information as to the nation’s degree of innovation.</p>
<p>Partnering with NCSES, SDAD aims to see if non-traditional data-sources can help supplement BRDIS and aid in measuring innovation. Our two main goals for the summer are firstly, understanding the degree to which innovation can be measured in text sources, such as news articles, and secondly, determining if from there we can then identify the innovative companies within the relevant industry sector.</p>
<!---How do i mention the NSF in relation to the NSCES and BRDIS? Hyperlink goes to BERD from last year's website? --->
<!---In addition to this survey, the annual business survey (ABS); Also: paragraph for goals of summer - understand the degree to which innovation can be measured in text sources, and from there, can we identify the companies who are innovating--->

<div id="dow-jones-news-and-analytics-dna" class="section level3">
<h3>Dow Jones News and Analytics (DNA)</h3>
<p><img src="images/dnalogo.png" /></p>
<p>The Dow Jones DNA platform collects information from Dow Jones publication with premium and licensed third party sources. This proprietary data platform contains 1.3bn articles each labeled with unique DNA taxonomies tags including word count, source name, and company code. More information on all the included data tags can be found on the DNA website. This dataset served as the primary resource for alternative text sources and will inspire the machine learning algorithms that will predict innovation.</p>

<h3>Labeling &amp; Training Data</h3>
<p>In order to train our BERT classification model for the purposes of predicting whether an article from the DNA database described an innovation or not, we first had to hand label a subset of 600 DNA articles. In preparation for this, our team reviewed the OSLO Manual, which as aforementioned, defines innovation, and provides the basis for collecting and reporting innovation data and publishing statistics on business innovation.</p>
<p>Our classification entailed not only labeling articles if they described an innovation or not, but several other fields that would later help fine tune our algorithm and yield data we could use for the purposes of Named Entity Recognition (NER). Specifically, if we classified an articles as a “yes” for innovation, we then also labeled the company name(s), where the name(s) was mentioned (title, snippet, and/or body), what the product name was, where it was mentioned, any tags on the product name if they existed (such as “TM” or “C” that could help tune our algorithm), and finally, what the features of the product were.</p>

<li>Dragontail Systems Uses Advanced AI and ML Technology to Optimize Operations and Enforce Food Safety Standards |Dragontail Systems Limited (ASX: DTS), a software company that optimizes the entire restaurant order and delivery process for global brands like Dominos and Pizza Hut, has announced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that it is updating its patented AI-based computer-vision quality management system, the QT AI camera, to detect cleanliness and sanitation. These enhancements are announced in conjunction with the company’s launch into the U.S. market and opening of an official New York office.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to monitoring key elements during the preparation and packing process, including the quality and accuracy of ingredients and temperature of the food, these enhancements specifically introduced to combat the spread of coronavirus will detect the presence of gloves and masks, and how often equipment and workspaces are sanitized and replaced. This information is closely monitored by managers and can be shared with the customer so as to ensure service compliance with defined quality standards.</p>
<p>“Dragontail Systems’ technology will empower fast-food services and restaurants of any size to address the growing concern of health and safety during the coronavirus pandemic,” said Ido Levanon, CEO and Director of Dragontail Systems. “Our unique AI camera already helps hundreds of stores recognize even the smallest of errors often undetected by the human eye, for example pizza toppings above and below the cheese, or even the food’s temperature. Now we are upgrading our technology to monitor processes that may lead to virus spread or contamination. In doing so, we expect to develop more impactful insights that foster transparency and ensure quality standards set by the businesses and the end-customer.”</p>
<p>The new QT AI Camera, in conjunction with Dragontail’s Algo Dispatching Systems, fully optimizes and automates the kitchen and dispatching flow, including order receipt and kitchen prioritization for meal preparation, as well as food packing, dispatch, route management, and delivery. By optimizing the entire restaurant operation, Dragontail Systems can turn any restaurant into a delivery powerhouse within just a couple of days.</p>
<p>“The food industry needs an edge-complete solution that is specially customized with the end product in mind. Our system is designed to take on the role of the super manager, processing every relevant data point inside and outside the restaurant and taking into consideration multiple variables such as number of orders and locations of customers and drivers, in order to optimize decisions at every point in the supply chain. This enables us to work directly with our customers to find more ways to streamline operations while bringing in more business, guaranteeing meals arrive hot and fresh, reducing costs and increasing repeat-customers,” continued Dragontail’s CEO.</p>
<p>At all times, the system enables real-time employee management that drives critical business decisions while calculating relevant variables that lead to more accurate and faster deliveries, as well as improvements in customer satisfaction and food quality and safety, all of which impact the bottom line. The system is versatile outside of the foodservice industry and can be utilized in a number of other verticals, including hotel room service, airline catering, supermarket delivery, same day couriers and technician dispatch.</p>

<p>Once this task of hand-labeling 600 news articles was finished, our team was then able to begin implementing Natural Language Processing methods, specifically the transformer-based BERT, to begin training our model on classification. However, prior to implementation, one last step was required: balancing our training data. Of the 600 articles we classified, 222 articles described an innovation. If we simply ran our BERT model on this unbalanced set, our model would be biased towards classifying an article as not describing an innovation. The solution to this issue was subsetting our “no” innovation articles to a random 222 article sample to only then run BERT on in order to reduce bias in our model.</p>
