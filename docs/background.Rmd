`github.io` means that there is a Github repo behind this website, and we also know the username and repo name:

**<http://jules32.github.io/rmarkdown-website-tutorial>** <=> **<https://github.com/jules32/rmarkdown-website-tutorial>** 

(Note: you can have github websites point to different urls if you don't want the `github.io`.)

<br>

### The website's repo

Let's go to **<https://github.com/jules32/rmarkdown-website-tutorial>**.  
  
**First, note the `gh-pages` branch** - this is critical for building free webpages. You can usually name branches whatever you want, but the `gh-pages` name means it can be built as a website. [I set it as my default branch](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-the-default-branch/).

**Now let's look at the filenames**. We can recognize the names of the webpages we've seen, and there is also a `_site.yml` file, which is the website's configuration file. The simplest website possible would have 2 files only: `_site.yml` and `index.Rmd`

## Fork to your account, clone to your computer

Let's start digging deeper and playing with this.  

1. Fork the [jules32/rmarkdown-website-tutorial](https://github.com/jules32/rmarkdown-website-tutorial) repo into your own account. 

2. Edit the URL for the website by replacing `jules32` with your GitHub username

3. Clone to your local computer using RStudio (preferred) the [Desktop App](https://desktop.github.com/), or the command line.
